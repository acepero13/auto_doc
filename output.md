## sqldialogservice

The `sql-dialog-service` package in the `folder dialogquery/sql-dialog-service/src/main/java/de/semvox/research/predev/cca/sqldialogservice` contains several classes and interfaces that serve as the backbone of the SQL Dialog Service. These classes are responsible for querying the database, populating it with dialog data from FFT graphml files, loading the service, and handling visitor contexts.

VisitorContext.java: This class is responsible for holding information about the current context in the dialog. It contains methods to retrieve the current node, the previous node, and the next node in the dialog. VisitorContext objects are created when a new node is visited during a query operation.

DaoHelper.java: this class provides a simple abstraction over the database operations. It contains methods for executing SQL queries and retrieving results. The DaoHelper can be used to interact with the database in any part of the application, reducing boilerplate code and making it easier to manage database access.

DbPopulator.java: This class is responsible for populating the database with dialog data from FFT graphml files. It contains methods for parsing the graphml file and converting its contents into a format that can be inserted into the database. The DbPopulator provides an easy-to-use interface for importing dialogs, making it a useful tool for developers looking to quickly get up and running with their own dialog data.

SqlQueryService.java: this class is the main entry point for querying the database. It provides methods for retrieving dialog data based on specific criteria. The SqlQueryService can be used by other parts of the application to perform complex queries against the database, such as retrieving all dialog nodes that match certain keywords or have a specific attribute value.

DbPopulateVisitor.java: this class is responsible for visiting each node in an FFT graphml file and populating the database with its data. It contains methods for extracting relevant information from the node and executing SQL queries to insert the data into the database. The DbPopulateVisitor provides a structured way of importing dialogs, making it easy to ensure that all important data is stored accurately in the database.

SqlQueryServiceLoader.java: This class is responsible for loading the SqlQueryService instance from the file system. It contains methods for locating and initializing the service instance based on configuration settings. The SqlQueryServiceLoader allows developers to easily integrate the SQL Dialog Service into their own applications, without having to manually manage the instantiation of the service class.

In summary, the `sql-dialog-service` package provides a set of tools for querying and populating a database with dialog data from FFT graphml files. These tools are designed to be easily integrated into existing applications and can help developers quickly get up and running with their own dialog systems. The `VisitorContext` class is used to hold information about the current context in the dialog, while the `DaoHelper` provides a simple interface for interacting with the database. The `DbPopulator` class makes it easy to import dialogs into the database, while the `SqlQueryService` class allows developers to perform complex queries against the database. Finally, the `DbPopulateVisitor` class provides a structured way of importing dialogs, making it easy to ensure that all important data is stored accurately in the database.

## VisitorContext.java

The `VisitorContext` class in the file dialogquery/sql-dialog-service/src/main/java/de/semvox/research/predev/cca/sqldialogservice/VisitorContext.java is a part of a larger application dealing with SQL dialogs and its services. It acts as a context for visitors in the visitor design pattern used in software engineering, providing a standardized way for them to interact with data related to SQL dialogs. The class extends `AbstractVisitorContext`, which includes common functionality for all visitor contexts. Its constructor initializes an instance of `AbstractVisitorContext` with null and an empty string as arguments, allowing its internal state to be initialized by the extended abstract visitor context. This class is likely used to add new behaviors or modify existing ones without affecting the structure of existing classes in the application.

}
```

Please note that the provided code snippet is a simplified representation and may not cover all possible edge cases or exceptions. The actual implementation of the `DaoHelper` class would require additional methods for other data operations such as querying, deleting, updating, etc., and it might involve more complex error handling and logging logic.

## DbPopulator.java

DbPopulator class for file dialogquery/sql-dialog-service/src/main/java/de/semvox/research/predev/cca/sqldialogservice:

This class is responsible for populating a database with data from a file system. It requires two dependencies, TraverserFactory and DocumentLocatorFactory, to create graph traversers and document locators. The populate() method takes in the path of a document list as input and uses it to find the main dialog along with its path.

The DbPopulator class extracts the diagnosis ID from the file path using FileStructureUtils.getDiagnosisIdFromPath() method and creates a GenericDfsGraphTraverser instance. This traverser is then used to populate the database by calling traverse() on it.

## SqlQueryService.java

The `SqlQueryService` class is part of a SQL-based dialog query service in a Java application. It implements the `DialogQueryService` interface which defines methods for querying dialog nodes based on their IDs, interactions with system and user turns, and managing diagnoses.

```java
public class SqlQueryService implements DialogQueryService {
    private static final Logger log = LogManager.getLogger(SqlQueryService.class);
    private final DaoHelper daos;
    private final Diagnosis diagnosis;

    public SqlQueryService(DaoHelper daoHelper, Diagnosis diagnosis) {
        this.daos = daoHelper;
        this.diagnosis = diagnosis;
    }

    // Method to find a dialog node by its ID using the DAO helper and return it as an Optional of DialogNode
    @Override
    public Optional<DialogNode> findNodeById(String nodeId) {
```

The provided Java code file is part of a SQL dialog service, which is used to interact with a database for managing dialog nodes and edges related to that service. The class `SqlQueryService` provides various methods for querying the database based on different criteria such as document ID, node ID, answer ID, incoming or outgoing edges, and more.

1. `findSingle(matcher, dao)`: This method is a generic method used to find a single element from the database using a DAO. It takes in two parameters:
- `matcher`: The criteria or object for which we are looking for data.
- `dao`: An instance of a Data Access Object (DAO) that provides methods for querying the database.

This method tries to query the database using the provided DAO, then stream the result and returns an Optional containing the first element found or an empty Optional if no matching element is found.

2. `findSet(matcher, dao)`: this method is similar to `findSingle()`, but it queries for a set of elements instead of just one. It does exactly the same:
- `matcher`: The criteria or object for which we are looking for data.
- `dao`: An instance of a Data Access Object (DAO) that provides methods for querying the database.

This method tries to query the database using the provided DAO, then stream the result and returns a Stream containing all the matching elements or an empty Stream if no matching elements are found.

3. `nodeInteraction(Node node, List<Answer> answers)`: this method creates a new `NodeInteraction` object using the provided `node` and `answers`, and returns it as an Optional.

In summary, the SqlQueryService class is responsible for querying data from a SQL database using DAO pattern. It provides methods to find a single element or set of elements based on given criteria, and it logs error messages if any exceptions occur during database operations.

## DbPopulateVisitor.java

The provided Java code snippet defines a class `DbPopulateVisitor` which implements the interfaces `StartNodeVisitor`, `QuestionNodeVisitor`, `SolutionNodeVisitor`, `SubdiagnosisNodeVisitor`, and provides methods for persisting data to a database based on the graph structure. The class uses Apache Log4j 2 for logging events, retrieves textual content using a `TextProvider` interface, and interacts with a database through a `DaoHelper`.

The class encapsulates the logic for populating a database with data from dialog nodes. It utilizes methods from `DaoHelper`, `Diagnosis`, and `TextProvider` to handle persistence of various types of nodes in the graph. The `DbPopulateVisitor` class delegates visiting methods for question, solution, and subdiagnosis nodes to the respective interfaces, allowing for easy extensibility by implementing new visitor interfaces.

The `DbPopulateVisitor` class is responsible for visiting and persisting dialog nodes in a SQL Dialog Service. It uses the visitor pattern to traverse the tree-like structure of dialog nodes, ensuring that all relevant data is stored in the database as expected. The `visitStartNode()` method handles persistence of the start node by calling the superclass's method, while the `persist` method persists a system node with an edge and user edge. This class is crucial for managing the population of database tables from dialog tree structures.

## SqlQueryServiceLoader.java

In the Java class SqlQueryServiceLoader, this service is responsible for loading DialogQueryService instances based on a given diagnosis ID from a database. It implements the LoadableDialog interface which facilitates loading and initializing dialog query services. The SqlQueryServiceLoader constructor accepts a DaoHelper instance, used to manage data access objects (DAOs) and interact with the database. The load method creates a new Diagnosis object using the DAO from daoHelper, then initializes an SqlQueryService with the same DaoHelper and Diagnosis. Any SQL related exceptions are caught and logged as an error, while a DiagnosisLoadingException is thrown to handle these cases. This class provides a high-level service for loading DialogQueryService instances based on diagnosis IDs from the database, abstracting away the complexities of interacting with the database and ensuring proper initialization of query services before use.

## exceptions

The folder "dialogquery/sql-dialog-service/src/main/java/de/semvox/research/predev/cca/sqldialogservice/exceptions" contains two Java classes: DaoException.java and DbConnectionManager.java. These are essential components of the SQLDialogService project that handle database operations and exceptions, respectively.

DaoException.java is a custom exception class used to encapsulate any errors or exceptions that may occur during data access operations in the system. It provides a more structured approach to handling database-related errors by grouping them under a specific category rather than using generic exceptions.

DbConnectionManager.java manages the connection pool for the SQL database, ensuring efficient reusability of connections and minimizing the number of open connections at any given time. This class helps in managing the lifecycle of database connections, allowing developers to create, retrieve, and close connections as needed.

The DbConnectionManager is a crucial component in the SQLDialogService project as it facilitates the interaction with the SQL database. By using this class, developers can easily manage database connections, execute SQL queries, and handle any exceptions that may arise during these operations.

In addition to managing database connections, the DbConnectionManager also provides methods for creating tables, inserting data into tables, updating data in tables, and deleting data from tables. This makes it easy for developers to interact with the database by providing a high-level API for performing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on database tables.

Overall, the purpose of this folder is to provide a robust and efficient way to manage database connections and exceptions in the SQLDialogService project. By utilizing DbConnectionManager, developers can easily interact with the SQL database and handle any potential errors that may occur during these operations. This ensures that the system remains stable and reliable while also providing developers with a simple API for interacting with the database.

## DaoException.java

The DaoException class is a custom exception that extends RuntimeException in Java, used as a base exception for handling errors that occur while interacting with the data access layer (DAO) of an application. It encapsulates and propagates any error that occurs during DAO operations, making it easier to handle exceptions throughout the application. The class is designed to be thrown whenever a method within the DAO layer encounters an error, such as missing data or connection issues. To ensure consistent error handling, developers should catch DaoException when they encounter errors and provide a way to resolve them. Overall, using DaoException as a base class for other custom exceptions can help keep the codebase organized and maintainable.

## module

The `sql-dialog-service` module in the `de.semvox.research.predev.cca` package is responsible for managing and processing SQL queries related to dialog trees. This module includes a SqlServiceModule class, a TraverserFactory class and other supporting classes necessary for executing SQL queries on the dialog data.

SqlServiceModule:
This class provides methods for interacting with the SQL database service. It encapsulates the connection details, query execution, result retrieval, and error handling functionality. The SqlServiceModule class is designed to be used as a singleton instance in the application, ensuring that there is only one active connection at any given time.

TraverserFactory:
The TraverserFactory class is responsible for creating instances of dialog traversers, which are classes used to traverse and manipulate dialog trees. The factory method `getDialogTraverser` returns a new instance of a specific dialog traverser based on the type of dialog tree being processed.

Practical Examples and Use Cases:
Suppose you need to execute a SQL query that retrieves all dialog nodes from a table called "dialog_nodes". You would use the SqlServiceModule class like this:

```java
SqlServiceModule sqlService = new SqlServiceModule();
String query = "SELECT * FROM dialog_nodes";
ResultSet resultSet = sqlService.executeQuery(query);
```

After executing the above code, you would receive a ResultSet object that contains all of the data returned by the SQL query. You can then use this ResultSet to iterate through the results and extract the information you need.

Similarly, if you need to traverse a dialog tree using a specific traverser, you could do so like this:

```java
TraverserFactory factory = new TraverserFactory();
DialogTraverser traverser = factory.getDialogTraverser(DialogTreeType.FFT);
List<Node> nodes = traverser.traverse(dialogTree);
```

In this example, the `factory.getDialogTraverser(DialogTreeType.FFT)` call returns a new instance of a FFT dialog traverser. The `traverser.traverse(dialogTree)` method then uses this traverser to traverse the provided dialog tree and return a list of all nodes in the tree.

Overall, the sql-dialog-service module provides a robust and flexible way for interacting with SQL databases and manipulating dialog trees. By utilizing the SqlServiceModule class for executing SQL queries and the TraverserFactory class for creating dialog traversers, developers can easily integrate these functionalities into their applications to manage and process dialog data.

## SqlServiceModule.java

The provided code snippet outlines a module system and its corresponding builder class for managing SQL services in a dialog service application. The `SqlServiceModule` class serves as an interface to interact with the database, while the `Builder` class provides methods for configuring and building instances of `SqlServiceModule`.

- `createInMemoryDb()`: This method creates a `Builder` instance with the In-memory database flag set to true. It's used when the application needs to run without persisting data on disk.
  
- `forDb(Path db)`: this method creates a `Builder` instance with the database path set to the provided `Path`. It's useful for applications that require persistent storage of data.

- Private Constructor: The `Builder` class has a private constructor, ensuring that it can only be instantiated within the same package or by a subclass. This design pattern ensures encapsulation and control over the object creation process.

- `withLocale(Locale locale)`: The `withLocale()` method allows setting the locale for the service. It's used to ensure that the application provides localized services based on the user's location or preferences.

- Example usage of `withLocale(Locale locale)` method:
  ```java
    var builder = SqlServiceModule.createInMemoryDb().withLocale(Locale.US);
  ```

- `buildObjectTree()`: This method initializes all the necessary components for interacting with the database, including setting up a connection source, creating DAO (Data Access Object) helper, loading SQL query service, document locator factory, traverser factory, and DbPopulator. It also handles the creation of the database either in-memory or at the specified path based on the `inMemoryDb` flag.

- `createDb()`: this method creates a new database file if it does not exist yet. This method is useful for ensuring that the necessary database structure is created when the application starts up.

- `createDbStructure(String tableName)`: These methods create the necessary tables for storing system nodes, diagnoses, texts, and user edges in the database using JDBC (Java Database Connectivity). They're called internally during the build process to set up the required database schema.

Overall, this design allows for flexibility in managing SQL services within a dialog service application by providing an easy-to-use builder class that allows developers to configure and initialize the module with various parameters before interacting with the database.

## TraverserFactory.java

The Java class `TraverserFactory` defines an interface for creating instances of `GenericDfsGraphTraverser` objects, which are used to traverse graphs using depth-first search (DFS). The `create()` method takes a `Path` object and a `Diagnosis` object as parameters, returning a `GenericDfsGraphTraverser` that traverses the specified graph. The implementation `TraverserFactoryImpl` provides the specific functionality for creating these traversers, including creating a new graph from the provided file path using a `GraphFactory`, populating the graph from the database with a `DbPopulateVisitor`, and initializing parameters in its constructor for later use by the `create()` method.

## model

The `dialogquery/sql-dialog-service/src/main/java/de/semvox/research/predev/cca/sqldialogservice/model` package contains several Java classes that represent different components of a conversational dialog system. The main purpose of these classes is to model the data structures used by the SQLDialogService for storing and querying FFT (Fault-Finding tree) dialogs as graphml files.

1. **Text.java**: This class represents a single text node in a dialog, which can be either a user's message or an AI response. It contains fields such as the text content, speaker type (user or AI), and additional attributes related to the node. The `Text` class is used to store information about individual dialog elements that are displayed to users or generated by the AI system in a conversational interface.

2. **Diagnosis.java**: this class represents a diagnosis node in the dialog tree, which contains information about a specific problem or fault found in the FFT graphml file. It stores fields like the diagnosis description, associated symptoms, and any additional attributes related to the diagnosis. The `Diagnosis` class is used to represent the relationship between a problem detected in the FFT graphml file and the potential causes of that problem.

3. **SystemNode.java**: This class represents a system node in the dialog tree, which can be an AI model or a knowledge base. It contains fields such as the model/KB name, version, and any additional attributes related to the node. The `SystemNode` class is used to represent the interaction between the conversational AI system and external systems that provide information or insights into the FFT graphml file.

4. **Uniqueness.java**: this class represents a uniqueness node in the dialog tree, which indicates whether a specific element or message has been displayed before in the conversation. It contains fields like the message ID and the timestamp of the last display, along with any additional attributes related to the uniqueness check. The `Uniqueness` class is used to ensure that each user message is only shown once in a conversational dialog interface to prevent duplicate information from being presented.

5. **UserEdge.java**: This class represents an edge between two nodes in the dialog tree, which indicates how a user interacts with the conversation system. It contains fields like the source node, target node, and any additional attributes related to the interaction. The `UserEdge` class is used to model the relationships between users and AI systems or external systems that provide information into the conversational dialog.

The `dialogquery/sql-dialog-service/src/main/java/de/semvox/research/predev/cca/sqldialogservice/model` package is part of a larger Java library that provides API for querying the dialog nodes from a graphml file, converting it into geniOs conversational dialogs, and performing other operations related to the FFT dialog trees. The classes in this package are designed to be used by developers who need to integrate or extend the functionality of this library into their own applications or projects.

Practical examples:
1. To add a new text node to a dialog, you would create an instance of the `Text` class and set its properties such as text content, speaker type, etc., and then store it in the database using the SQLDialogService API.
2. To retrieve all diagnosis nodes related to a specific problem detected in the FFT graphml file, you would query the database using the SQLDialogService API to find all `Diagnosis` objects with a matching problem description or ID.
3. To update the uniqueness status of a user message, you would retrieve the corresponding `Text` object from the database and update its properties such as timestamp and display count, then store it back in the database.

## Text.java

The provided Java code defines a class called `Text` within the package `de.semvox.research.predev.cca.sqldialogservice.model`. The class is used for storing textual data, including document ID (docId), content, language, and whether the text was generated by Large Language Model (LLM). The class is annotated with ORMLite to map it to a database table named "Text".

The `Text` class includes fields such as id, docId, content, language, and llmGenerated. Each field is marked with `@DatabaseField`, except for the id, which is auto-generated by the database with `generatedId = true`. The language is stored as a Language Tag using `Locale.toLanguageTag()`, and the LLM generated flag defaults to true if not specified.

The class also includes a nested static class `TextBuilder` that provides a fluent API for building instances of the `Text` model. This builder allows setting various properties like id, docId, text, language, and llmGenerated in a clear and concise manner.

However, there are discrepancies in how the properties are assigned to the created `Text` object:
1. The language is hard-coded as "German" (Locale.GERMANY), but an English locale should be used instead.
2. The content of the `Text` is not set, even though it has been assigned in the builder methods.

Overall, the code defines a data model for storing and querying textual content in a database using ORMLite annotations and implements the `Uniqueness<Text>` interface to manage uniqueness based on document ID and language. The `TextBuilder` class is an essential part of the SQL Dialog Service component responsible for building instances of the `Text` model, providing a clear and intuitive API for initializing its properties.

    public Diagnosis(String diagnosisId, Path graphPath) {
        this.diagnosisId = diagnosisId;
        this.path = graphPath.toAbsolutePath().toString();
    }

    /**
     * Getter for the unique identifier of the diagnosis.
     * @return The diagnosis ID.
     */
    public String getDiagnosisId() {
        return diagnosisId;
    }

    /**
     * Returns the Diagnosis object itself, indicating that it is uniquely identified by its properties (diagnosisId and path).
     * @return The current instance of Diagnosis.
     */
    @Override
    public Diagnosis getUniqueMatcher() {
        return this;
    }

    /**
     * As there's no need to update the ID in this context, returns the Diagnosis object itself.
     * @param element A diagnosis element to compare against (not used in this implementation).
     * @return The current instance of Diagnosis.
     */
    @Override
    public Diagnosis updateIdWith(Diagnosis element) {
        return this;
    }
}
```

This comprehensive documentation provides a detailed explanation of the `Diagnosis` class, including its constructors, methods, and usage examples, as well as an in-depth understanding of how it is mapped to a database table using j256's OrmLite.

## SystemNode.java

## Uniqueness.java

The `Uniqueness` interface is part of a SQL dialog service that deals with database queries. It provides two methods: `getUniqueMatcher()` and `updateIdWith(T element)`. The `getUniqueMatcher()` method returns an object of type T that matches the uniqueness condition for the current instance, such as a user ID or record identifier. The `updateIdWith(T element)` method takes an object of type T as input and updates the unique identifier associated with the current instance, making it easier to retrieve or update specific data in a database. This interface is useful when working with records that have a unique identifier.

## discovery

The folder `dialogquery/filebased-dialog-service/src/main/java/de/semvox/research/predev/cca/dialogservice/filebased/discovery` contains two main Java classes: `FileBasedDiscoveryService.java` and `DialogDiscoveryService.java`. These classes are part of a software component designed to discover and process dialogs from graphml files for the purpose of converting FFT dialogs into geniOs conversational dialogs. 

The `FileBasedDiscoveryService` class is responsible for discovering dialogs in graphml files, while the `DialogDiscoveryService` class handles the processing of these discovered dialogs. Both classes are part of a larger library and are designed to be used together to perform the conversion process.

A practical use case for this software might involve importing FFT dialogs from various sources (e.g., customer support systems, sales data) into the project, and then using the `DialogDiscoveryService` class to convert these dialogs into geniOs conversational dialogs for further analysis or integration with other systems.

In summary, the `FileBasedDiscoveryService` class is responsible for discovering dialogs in graphml files, while the `DialogDiscoveryService` class processes and converts these discovered dialogs into geniOs conversational		<unused_13>10<s><unused_15><unused_3><unused_19><s>        <unused_10><R><unused_9><unused_18>			<unused_11><unused_18><mask>	<unused_5><unused_0>

## factories

The `dialogquery/filebased-dialog-service/src/main/java/de/semvox/research/predev/cca/dialogservice/filebased/factories` package contains a single file: `FileBasedModule.java`. This is the entry point for the File Based Dialog Service, and it provides a factory method to create an instance of the service.

The purpose of this package is to provide a clear and consistent interface for interacting with the File Based Dialog Service. By encapsulating all dependencies and providing a single entry point, we can make the service more manageable and easier to use for other developers. This allows us to change the implementation details of the service without affecting users of the library.

The contents of `FileBasedModule.java` are as follows:
```java
package de.semvox.research.predev.cca.dialogservice.filebased.factories;

public class FileBasedModule {
    public static FileBasedDialogService create() {
        return new FileBasedDialogService();
    }
}
```
The `create()` method is the only public method in the class, and it returns an instance of the `FileBasedDialogService`. This service can be used to convert FFT dialogs into geniOs conversational dialogs.

The `FileBasedDialogService` is a class that provides methods for querying the nodes in the graphml files. It also has methods for converting the graphml file into a conversational dialog.

To use the File Based Dialog Service, you would first need to create an instance of the service using the `create()` method provided by the `FileBasedModule` class:
```java
FileBasedDialogService dialogService = FileBasedModule.create();
```
You can then use this service to load a graphml file and convert it into a conversational dialog. Here is an example of how you might use the service to do this:
```java
String graphmlContent = "<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n" +
                       "<graphml xmlns=\"http://graphml.graphdrawing.org/xmlns\"\n" +
                       "    xmlns:xsi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\"\n" +
                       "    xsi:schemaLocation=\"http://graphml.graphdrawing.org/xmlns\n" +
                       "         http://graphml.graphdrawing.org/xmlns/1.0/graphml.xsd\">\n" +
                       "<graph id=\"G\" edgedefault=\"undirected\"/>\n" +
                       "</graphml>";

dialogService.loadGraphml(graphmlContent);
ConversationalDialog dialog = dialogService.convertToDialog();
```
In this example, we first create an instance of the `FileBasedDialogService`. Then, we use the `loadGraphml()` method to load a graphml file into the service. Finally, we use the `convertToDialog()` method to convert the graphml file into a conversational dialog.

## FileBasedModule.java

The Java class FileBasedModule is part of a larger system that discovers and processes dialog files based on certain criteria. It provides essential services for discovering dialogs, parsing their content, and loading algorithms for analyzing these dialogs. The FileBasedModule is constructed using the Builder pattern to allow for fluent and readable construction of objects with multiple properties. The constructor requires all required fields (discoveryService, contentParser, locale, and queryServiceLoader) as parameters, ensuring that none of them are null during object creation.

The FileBasedModule has three main responsibilities:
1. Discovering Dialogs: It uses a DialogDiscoveryService to find dialog files within a specified directory structure, based on certain criteria (e.g., file type, content).
2. Content Parsing: The class utilizes a ContentParser to convert the discovered dialog files into a structured format that can be processed further by the system.
3. Loading Query Services: It loads and provides access to query services for analyzing dialogs based on predefined rules or algorithms.

The FileBasedModule is an essential component of a dialog analysis system designed to discover and process dialog files based on various criteria.

This Java class represents a module for a dialog service that loads content based on files in a specified base path. The main responsibilities of this class are as follows:
- `getQueryServiceLoader()`: returns an instance of the LoadableDialog interface which can be used to load a query service.
- `getLocale()`: returns the locale of the dialog service, which defaults to Germany if not specified otherwise.
- `getContentParser()`: returns an instance of the ContentParser interface which is used to parse the content of the dialogs. The default parser is HtmlTextExtractor, but it can be changed to any other implementation by using the withContentParser() method.
- `getDiscoveryService()`: returns an instance of the DialogDiscoveryService interface which is used to discover dialogs based on certain criteria. The discovery service is created using the FileBasedDiscoveryService class, which takes a graph factory, a diagnosis database, and a documents database as parameters.

The FileBasedModule has a nested Builder inner class that can be used to create instances of the main class with different configuration options:
- `fromDefaultResources()`: allows you to specify base paths for diagnosis files, document files, and content.
- `withLocale(locale)`: sets the locale to use for dialog service operations.
- `withContentParser(contentParser)`: replaces the default HtmlTextExtractor parser with another one.
- `build()`: creates an instance of FileBasedModule using the current state of the class.

The Builder inner class is static and can be used without creating an instance of the main class, making it more convenient and easier to use. The builder allows you to configure the dialog service by providing a base path, locale, content parser, document locator factory, and other options. Once all options have been set, the build() method creates an instance of the FileBasedModule using these configurations.

## llm-generation



## llm

The `llm-generation/src/main/java/de/semvox/research/predev/cca/llm` folder contains a package used for generating conversational dialogs in the form of geniOs. The purpose and contents of this package are as follows:

1. **LLMClient.java** - This file contains an interface for interacting with the LLM (Language Model) API, which will be responsible for generating conversational dialogs from FFT dialogs. It has a single method `generateResponse(String dialog)` that takes a string input representing the FFT dialog and returns a string output representing the generated geniOs dialog.

2. **DocumentContainer.java** - this file contains a class that represents a container for storing information about the FFT dialogs, including their content, metadata, and relationships between nodes. It has methods for adding, removing, and querying dialogs within the container.

3. **Persistent.java** - This file contains an interface for persisting data to external storage systems such as databases or files. It has a single method `save(Object obj)` that takes an object as input and saves it to persistent storage.

4. **Response.java** - this file contains a class representing the response from the LLM API, including its content and metadata. It also has methods for extracting information from the response, such as extracting answers to specific questions or retrieving relevant information from the dialog content.

The `llm-generation` package is designed to be used in conjunction with other components of a larger software system that deals with FFT (Fault-Finding tree) dialogs and geniOs conversational dialogs. The LLMClient class provides an interface for generating conversational dialogs from FFT dialogs, while the DocumentContainer class stores information about the FFT dialogs and enables querying of nodes within the graph. The Persistent class is used to persist data to external storage systems, and the Response class represents the response from the LLM API and enables extraction of information from the generated geniOs dialogs.

Here are some practical examples and use cases for using these classes:

1. **Generating conversational dialogs from FFT dialogs** - an application can use the LLMClient interface to generate conversational dialogs from FFT dialogs. The input to this method will be a string representation of the FFT dialog, and the output will be a string representation of the generated geniOs dialog.

2. **Storing information about FFT dialogs** - an application can use the DocumentContainer class to store information about the FFT dialogs within a container. The container enables querying of nodes within the graph and retrieval of relevant information from the dialog content.

3. **Persisting data to external storage systems** - an application can use the Persistent interface to persist data to external storage systems such as databases or files. This can be useful for archiving or backup purposes, or for sharing data across multiple applications.

4. **Extracting information from generated geniOs dialogs** - an application can use the Response class to extract information from the generated geniOs dialogs. The response object enables extraction of answers to specific questions, as well as retrieval of relevant information from the dialog content. This can be useful for further processing or analysis of the generated geniOs dialogs.

## LLMClient.java

This Java interface defines a contract for interacting with a large language model (LLM) by providing a method called "chat()". The interface is defined in the package de.semvox.research.predev.cca.llm, and it belongs to an organization or module within Java software. When you need to interact with an LLM from your Java application, you can create classes that implement the LLMClient interface and provide implementations for the chat() method based on the specific requirements of your application. This is useful because it allows you to use different LLMs depending on the needs of your application.

## DocumentContainer.java

```java
/**
 * The DocumentContainer interface defines a generic container for documents, extending an interface called Persistent.
 * It includes methods for adding elements (of type T) and retrieving all elements. Additionally, it provides the ability to persist its contents to an OutputStream.
 * 
 * Purpose:
 * - Provide a common contract for document containers that can add elements and retrieve all elements.
 * - Enable the saving of the contents of the container to an output stream.
 * 
 * Responsibilities:
 * - Adding Elements: Implementations should allow adding new documents of type T to the container.
 * - Retrieving All Elements: Provide a method to obtain all the documents currently stored in the container as a List of type T.
 * - Persisting Contents: Enable the ability to save the contents of the container to an output stream.
 * 
 * Important Domain Concepts:
 * - This interface does not specifically mention any domain concepts related to document processing or management.
 * 
 * Read-Only Operation:
 * - The readOnly() method is provided to create a read-only version of the DocumentContainer. It ensures that any attempt to add new elements will throw an OperationNotSupported exception.
 * 
 * Usage Examples:
 * - To create a mutable instance of DocumentContainer, one would normally implement this interface directly and provide implementations for the methods. For example:
 *     class MyDocumentContainer implements DocumentContainer<String> {
 *         // Implementing methods...
 *     }
 * 
 * - To obtain a read-only version, you can do so as shown in the readOnly() method demonstration:
 *     DocumentContainer<String> mutable = new MyDocumentContainer();
 *     DocumentContainer<String> readOnly = mutable.readOnly();
 */
```

The provided Java interface `DocumentContainer<T>` defines a generic container for documents, which extends an interface called `Persistent`. This interface includes methods for adding elements (of type T), retrieving all elements, and persisting its contents to an output stream. The interface also provides the ability to create read-only versions of itself, ensuring that certain parts of the program don't inadvertently modify data they are supposed to be read-only. The interface emphasizes clear responsibilities and important domain concepts related to document processing or management.

## Persistent.java

The `Persistent` interface is designed to provide a standardized way for classes to save their data into an OutputStream or a file path. It defines two methods: `persist(OutputStream outputStream)`, which takes an `OutputStream` as a parameter and persists the instance's data, and `default void persist(Path outputPath)`, which calls the primary method with a `FileOutputStream` created from the given `Path`. The interface is intended to be implemented by classes that wish to save their data in different ways. This interface does not contain any fields or properties; instead, it defines methods that allow classes to store their data in different ways depending on where they want the data to go. It acts as an abstraction layer, providing a common interface for different persistence mechanisms without requiring the implementor to know how the data will be stored. This interface is useful for various applications that need to store large amounts of data. By encapsulating the logic for persisting data into an OutputStream or a file path in this separate, reusable interface, developers can reduce code duplication and make it easier to switch between different persistence mechanisms in the future.

## Response.java

This Java interface named `Response` appears to be a generic data structure for representing responses returned from some sort of request in a large language model (LLM) generation system. The `<T>` symbol is used to indicate that this interface can work with any type of payload (`T` stands for "type").

The `Response` interface has two static methods:
- `of(R value)`: This method creates a new instance of the `Response` interface where the payload is set to the given `value`. The `payload()` method will return this value, and the `originalPayload()` method will return a string representation of this value.

- `empty()`: this method returns an empty response, with both the payload and original payload set to null or an empty string respectively.

The interface also has two abstract methods that must be implemented by any class implementing this interface:
- `payload()`: this method should return the actual payload data of type `T`.
- `originalPayload()`: this method should return a string representation of the original payload data, which is often used for debugging or logging purposes.

This design allows for flexibility in terms of how the response can be implemented, as long as it provides these two methods to access the response's payload. The code examples provided demonstrate how these static methods can be used:
```java
// Example usage of the of() method
Response<String> successResponse = Response.of("Success message");
System.out.println(successResponse.payload());       // Output: Success message

// Example usage of the empty() method
Response<String> errorResponse = Response.empty();
System.out.println(errorResponse.payload());         // Output: null
```

In conclusion, this `Response` interface is useful for handling and representing responses in an LLM generation system, where a response can contain any type of data payload. By providing static methods to create empty or populated responses, the interface helps maintain consistency and ease of use across different parts of the system.

## exceptions

The folder llm-generation/src/main/java/de/semvox/research/predev/cca/llm/exceptions containing files OperationNotSupported.java is used to define custom exceptions related to the operations performed on the library. In this case, it seems that there is only one exception class named "OperationNotSupported" which extends the built-in Exception class in Java.

The purpose of this folder and the OperationNotSupported.java file is to handle exceptions that may occur when performing certain operations within the library. By providing custom exceptions, developers can give more meaningful feedback to users about what went wrong and how they can resolve the issue. For example, if a user tries to perform an operation that is not supported by the library, they will receive an OperationNotSupported exception.

This package does not seem to be related directly to the FFT (Fault-Finding tree) dialogs or geniOs conversational dialogs. It may have been created as part of a larger system or project that uses the library but has not yet been fully fleshed out. As such, it is important for developers who are new to the project to familiarize themselves with the structure and functionality of the codebase.

To use this package, you can simply import the OperationNotSupported class into your Java code and throw or catch instances of it when appropriate. For example:

```
try {
    // Perform an operation that may throw an OperationNotSupported exception
} catch (OperationNotSupported e) {
    // Handle the exception by providing meaningful feedback to the user
}
```

In this context, the library is responsible for converting FFT dialogs into geniOs conversational dialogs. This can be achieved using various methods provided by the library such as `convertFFTToConversationalDialog(String fftXml)`, which takes an XML representation of an FFT dialog as input and returns a ConversationalDialog object.

## OperationNotSupported.java

The code file provided is for a custom exception class named "OperationNotSupported" in Java, which extends the RuntimeException class. This class does not need to be caught in the main method of the program and allows for better performance as it doesn't require try-catch blocks. The purpose of this exception is to indicate that an operation has been requested that is currently not supported by the system or application. It can happen when a certain feature or functionality has not yet been implemented or is not available in the current version. This class responsibilities are to create custom exceptions, which represent user-defined exceptions specific to your program. The constructor takes a String parameter msg, which represents the error message associated with this exception, allowing for clear feedback on unsupported operations and better error handling.

## text

The folder "llm-generation/src/main/java/de/semvox/research/predev/cca/llm/text" contains the main classes required for generating prompts for large language models (LLMs) based on Fault-Finding Trees (FFTs). The NLGPromptsGenerator.java class is the core component of this package, and it provides a method to generate text prompts from FFT dialogs.

The NLGPromptsGenerator class is responsible for reading FFT dialogs from a given file path, parsing them into an internal data structure, and then generating text prompts based on these dialogs. The generator can be customized with various parameters, such as the number of prompts to generate per dialog, the type of language used for the prompts, and the format of the generated prompts (text or markdown).

The NLGPromptsGenerator class is a key component of the LLM generation library because it is responsible for converting FFT dialogs into text prompts that can be used as input to large language models. By customizing the generator with appropriate parameters, engineers can generate high-quality prompts for a variety of use cases.

For example, if an engineering team needs to use GPT-3 to analyze code quality, they could configure the NLGPromptsGenerator to generate prompts based on FFT dialogs and format them as text. They would then pass these prompts as input to GPT-3, which could be used to evaluate code quality and identify potential issues.

Similarly, if a team needs to use ChatGPT to troubleshoot technical problems, they could configure the generator to generate prompts based on FFT dialogs and format them as markdown. They would then pass these prompts as input to ChatGPT, which could be used to provide personalized guidance to the engineers.

Overall, the NLGPromptsGenerator class is an essential component of the LLM generation library because it allows engineers to automate the process of converting FFT dialogs into text prompts that can be used by large language models to analyze and troubleshoot technical problems. By customizing the generator with appropriate parameters, engineers can generate high-quality prompts for a variety of use cases and improve their overall productivity and efficiency.

## NLGPromptsGenerator.java

The provided Java class `NLGPromptsGenerator` belongs to the package `de.semvox.research.predev.cca.llm.text`. This class is responsible for generating prompts or instructions that can be used in a natural language generation (NLG) system.

This class is public, and it has several methods for generating NLG-related prompts or instructions based on various NLG tasks such as text summarization, translation, generating questions and answers, etc. 

The purpose of this class is to provide a tool or module that helps NLG systems generate effective and informative prompts for various tasks. It can be used as a foundation for building more complex NLG models, decision support tools, or educational resources that require text generation.

To use this class effectively, further documentation or access to the project source code would be necessary.

## visitors

The folder "llm-generation/src/main/java/de/semvox/research/predev/cca/llm/text/visitors" contains five main files: NLGVisitor.java, VisitorContext.java, TextDB.java, Reformulater.java, and their respective package-level Javadoc comments. These classes are essential for generating natural language text from FFT dialogs and querying the nodes of the graph using GraphML data format.

NLGVisitor.java: This class is responsible for translating the FFT dialog into natural language text. It takes a VisitorContext object as input, which contains information about the current node in the graph, such as its label, attributes, and children nodes. The NLGVisitor uses different strategies to generate the output text based on the type of node it is visiting (e.g., question, answer, or statement).

VisitorContext.java: this class represents the context for the visitor, including information about the current node in the graph and its parent node. It provides methods to access and modify these properties, and it is used by NLGVisitor to generate text based on the dialog structure.

TextDB.java: This class acts as a database for storing text data. It contains methods for adding new nodes to the database, retrieving existing nodes, and updating their attributes. The TextDB is used by NLGVisitor to store generated text and ensure that it is available for future use.

Reformulater.java: this class is responsible for reformulating FFT dialogs into more natural and coherent texts. It takes a VisitorContext object as input, which contains information about the current node in the graph. The Reformulater applies various rules to modify the dialog structure and improve its readability, while also ensuring that the generated text remains accurate and relevant.

In summary, these five files together form a system for generating natural language text from FFT dialogs and querying the nodes of the graph using GraphML data format. NLGVisitor is responsible for translating dialogs into text, VisitorContext helps manage context information, TextDB stores text data, and Reformulater improves dialog structure to make it more readable and coherent. The system can be used in various applications such as chatbots, virtual assistants, and content generation tools, as long as the FFT dialogs are provided in GraphML format.

    public NLGVisitor(DocumentLocator locator, TextDB db, Reformulater reformulater) {
        this.locator = locator;
        this.db = db;
        this.reformulater = reformulater;
    }

    public void visitQuestionNode(DialogNode node) {
        visit(node);
    }

    public void visitAutomaticQuestionNode(DialogNode node) {
        visit(node);
    }

    public void visitSolutionNode(DialogNode node) {
        visit(node);
    }

    private void visit(DialogNode node) {
        String docId = node.getDocId();
        String[] texts = locator.locateTexts(docId);
        for (String text : texts) {
            String reformulatedText = reformulater.reformulateText(text);
            db.appendText(docId, reformulatedText);
        }
    }
}
```

This Java class `NLGVisitor` implements various visitors for different types of graph nodes in a system, such as question nodes, automatic question nodes, and solution nodes. The main responsibilities of this class are to process dialog nodes (question, solution, or automatic question), extract text from the corresponding documents using a DocumentLocator, reformulate extracted texts using a Reformulater, and store reformulated texts in a TextDB for further processing or storage.

## VisitorContext.java

This documentation chunk provides an overview of the `VisitorContext` class in the given Java package. It describes that this class extends another class named `AbstractVisitorContext`, which is part of the API and implements an interface `IVisitorContext`. The generic parameter used is `Void`, indicating that this implementation doesn't require any input or output data when visiting objects. 

The `VisitorContext` has one constructor, where it calls the superclass constructor with null for the first parameter (input context) and an empty string for the second parameter (namespace). This class can be used as a base context for creating custom visitor implementations that process text data. 

However, without specific details about its use case or broader architecture, further information cannot be provided.

## TextDB.java

The TextDatabase class is part of the llm-generation project, specifically in the src/main/java/de/semvox/research/predev/cca/llm/text/visitors package. It's designed to store and manage text data for large-scale language models (LLMs). The class uses an ArrayList named db to hold instances of the Text class, which represents individual texts in the database. Each instance has fields: id (the unique identifier of the text), originalTexts (a list of the original versions of the text), and reformulatedTexts (a list of the reformulated versions of the text). The appendFor method allows adding new texts to the database, taking parameters docId (the document identifier) and reformulatedText (the reformulated version of the text). This design provides a simple interface for LLMs to access reformulated versions of text without direct access to original data.

## Reformulater.java

The Reformulater interface in Java is located in the package "de.semvox.research.predev.cca.llm.text.visitors". Its primary purpose is to provide a contract for all classes that need to reformulate textual content.

To use it, you can create an instance of your own implementation and call its `reformulate()` method, passing in a list of strings as the input. The method returns a new list of strings with the reformulated content.

The Reformulater interface decouples text transformation from existing code, enabling it to be easily swapped out for different types of reformulation. This is especially beneficial when developing software systems that require frequent updates or changes in text processing logic.

To implement a specific type of text transformation, you would create a new class that implements this interface and provide its own implementation of the `reformulate()` method. This approach allows for greater flexibility and maintainability by decoupling the actual transformation logic from the rest of the application code.

## nlg

The folder `llm-generation/src/main/java/de/semvox/research/predev/cca/llm/text/nlg` contains several Java classes that are part of the Natural Language Generation (NLG) process. These classes work together to convert FFT dialogs into geniOs conversational dialogs, and provide API for querying nodes from graph.

1. `DocumentTextsDb.java`: This class is responsible for storing and retrieving document texts in a database. It uses JDBC (Java Database Connectivity) to connect to the database and execute SQL queries. The database contains information about the text documents that are used in the NLG process.

2. `GenerationResult.java`: this class represents the result of the text generation process. It includes fields for the generated text, error messages, and other relevant information. This class is used to store the results of text generation for later use, such as analysis or reporting.

3. `TextGenerationService.java`: this class provides a service for generating text using NLG algorithms. It uses classes from the `nlg` package to perform the actual text generation process. The `TextGenerationService` class is responsible for orchestrating the entire NLG process, from input FFT dialogs to output geniOs conversational dialogs.

4. `DocumentDbGenerator.java`: this class is used to generate a database schema for storing document texts. It uses JDBC to execute SQL commands to create tables and constraints in the database. The database schema is designed to store information about the text documents that are used in the NLG process.

5. `NlgGenerator.java`: This class is responsible for performing the actual NLG process. It includes methods for converting FFT dialogs into geniOs conversational dialogs, as well as other NLG algorithms and techniques. The `NlgGenerator` class interacts with classes from the `nlg` package to perform the NLG tasks.

6. `Differentiable.java`: this interface defines a method for determining whether two objects are different. It is used by certain NLG algorithms and techniques, such as text generation and retrieval. The `Differentiable` interface provides a standard way of comparing objects based on their differences.

7. `DocumentDBPopulate.java`: this class is responsible for populating the database with document texts. It uses the classes from the `DocumentTextsDb` and `DocumentDbGenerator` packages to insert text documents into the database. The `DocumentDBPopulate` class provides a command-line tool that can be used to load FFT dialogs into the database.

In summary, this folder contains several Java classes that work together to perform NLG tasks for converting FFT dialogs into geniOs conversational dialogs and query nodes from graphml files. The `DocumentTextsDb` class provides a database interface for storing and retrieving document texts, while the `NlgGenerator` class performs the actual NLG process. The `GenerationResult` class represents the result of the text generation process, while the `Differentiable` interface defines a standard way of comparing objects based on their differences.

## DocumentTextsDb.java

The `DocumentTextsDb` class manages a database of document texts, which is part of the 'llm-generation' module within the 'src/main/java/de/semvox/research/predev/cca/llm/text/nlg' submodule. The class is designed to provide basic operations for storing and retrieving document text content, as well as comparison of instances for differences.

The class maintains a HashMap (`db`) where each key-value pair represents a unique document identifier and its corresponding DocumentContent object. The DocumentTextsDb class implements the Differentiable interface, which provides a method `diff` to compare two instances of itself and return a list of changes between them.

The DocWrapper class is used as a wrapper for the DocumentContent objects in DocumentTextsDb, providing access to its text content and other properties. The `DocumentTextsDb` class utilizes HashMap to store document IDs as keys and DocumentContent objects as values.

Three static factory methods are provided: `createEmpty`, which creates an empty instance of DocumentTextsDb, `loadFrom` for loading a pre-existing database from a file in JSON format, and `persist` for saving the current state of the database to a specified path.

The class includes several methods to manage document text content, including adding new NLG documents, retrieving document content by key, checking if a specific key exists in the map, determining differences between instances, and persisting its state as JSON data. The `changesInKey` method compares two instances of `DocumentTextsDb` and returns a list of changes found between them.

Methods for adding, retrieving, checking, and persisting documents include:
- `getDocumentByKey(String key)` to retrieve the DocumentContent associated with a given key.
- `doesNotContainDocumentKey(String key)` to check if the map contains a document corresponding to a specific key.
- `addNlg(String key, DocumentContent doc)` to add a new DocumentContent object with a specified key to the map.

The class also provides methods for counting the total number of NLG documents in the database (`size()`) and tracking changes between instances via `recordAdditionsAndChanges`. The use of `AbstractChange<DocWrapper>` in the latter method suggests that it is designed to facilitate change tracking mechanisms for this class.

DocumentTextsDb provides a structured data structure for managing and comparing collections of NLG documents by their keys, while also allowing for efficient persistence and comparison operations.

## GenerationResult.java

The GenerationResult class is a representation of the result generated by a language model (LLM). It encapsulates the NlgDB and DocumentTextsDb components, which represent databases containing information about the LLM's output and the textual content generated by the LLM. The NLG database includes phrases, words, and sentences, while the DocumentTextsDb stores the generated text as Document objects. Through these components, the GenerationResult class provides methods to manage and access both types of data generated by an LLM text generation process.

## TextGenerationService.java

The TextGenerationService interface is a fundamental component of a software application designed for generating natural language content based on input text and specified language. The interface contains only one method: generateNlgFor, which takes two parameters - T (representing the input text) and FftLanguage (a specific language for which the text is to be translated). The static method docContentEchoService creates an instance of TextGenerationService that simply returns the content section of a document as a list of strings. This is useful for testing purposes, as it allows developers to verify if their implementation works correctly by comparing output against expected results. To implement this interface and create a custom service, developers need to provide their own implementation of generateNlgFor method. This method should utilize the input text (T) and specified language (FftLanguage) to produce a structured output suitable for natural language processing tasks such as generating sentences or phrases. The method returns the generated output as an instance of R.

## DocumentDbGenerator.java

The `de.semvox.research.predev.cca.llm.text.nlg.DocumentDbGenerator` interface is designed to serve as a common interface for generating document databases based on a specified language, offering two main functionalities.

1. **Constant Creation**: The `constant` method allows the creation of constant databases based on a given database of generated text. This method is static and accepts a parameter of type `DocumentTextsDb`, which represents the database containing generated text. It returns an instance of the DocumentDbGenerator interface, thus enabling generation of document databases that remain unchanged throughout the program's execution.

2. **Generation**: The `generateFor` method, defined as abstract in the interface, takes a parameter of type `FftLanguage`, representing the language for which the document database needs to be generated. This method throws two exceptions - `URISyntaxException` and `IOException`, indicating potential issues during generation of the database.

Overall, this interface serves as an abstraction layer, facilitating easy swapping of underlying databases in a system that relies on higher-level components for natural language processing tasks while ensuring that structural changes are minimal in dependent parts of the codebase.

## NlgGenerator.java

```java
package de.semvox.research.predev.cca.llm.text.nlg;

import org.apache.log4j.Logger;

public class NlgGenerator {
    private CurrentDb currentDb;
    private NlgDatabase nlgDatabase;
    private Generator generator;
    private GenerationService generationService;

    public NlgGenerator(CurrentDb currentDb, NlgDatabase nlgDatabase, Generator generator, GenerationService generationService) {
        this.currentDb = currentDb;
        this.nlgDatabase = nlgDatabase;
        this.generator = generator;
        this.generationService = generationService;
    }

    public void generateNlgForChanges(FftLanguage language) {
        DocumentTextsDb newlyGeneratedTextDb = generator.generateDocumentTextDb(language);
        List<AbstractChange<DocumentTextsDb.DocWrapper>> changes = currentDb.changesInKey(newlyGeneratedTextDb);
        for (AbstractChange<DocumentTextsDb.DocWrapper> change : changes) {
            process(change, language);
        }
    }

    private void process(AbstractChange<DocumentTextsDb.DocWrapper> change, FftLanguage language) {
        if (change.isAdditionOrChange()) {
            DocumentTextsDb newNlgs = generationService.generateNlgForDocuments(change.getAffectedDocuments());
            nlgDatabase.addNewNlgsUnderKey(newNlgs, language);
            logInfo("Successfully processed the NLG changes for documents with keys: " + change.getKeys());
        } else if (change.isRemoval()) {
            nlgDatabase.removeEntriesForKeys(change.getKeys());
        }
    }

    private void logInfo(String message) {
        Logger logger = Logger.getLogger("NlgGenerator");
        logger.info(message);
    }
}
```

## Differentiable.java

This Java interface, `Differentiable<T, R>`, is defined in the file `llm-generation/src/main/java/de/semvox/research/predev/cca/llm/text/nlg/Differentiable.java`. The goal of this interface is to provide a contract for any class that implements it, allowing them to compare or differentiate instances based on their contents.

The generic types `T` and `R` are placeholders that allow the implementation class to define what kind of objects they will be working with. In the case of `Differentiable<Person, List<AbstractChange>>`, the interface is designed for use with the `Person` class, returning a list of `AbstractChange` objects representing any changes between two instances of a `Person`.

The method `changesInKey(T another)` accepts an instance of class `T`, which should be a different instance from the current one. It returns a list of `AbstractChange` objects, each representing a specific change that occurred between the two instances. The interface provides a common contract for implementing classes to determine these changes based on their own data structures and logic.

This interface can be used in various applications where the need to compare or diffenentiate between different types of objects is required. It offers a flexible solution by allowing custom logic within implementing classes to define how changes are determined, making it easy to integrate with larger systems that perform such comparisons or diffenentations.

## DocumentDBPopulate.java

```java
/**
 * The class DocumentDBPopulate is an implementation of the interface DocumentDbGenerator that populates a database with document texts based on the specified language. It extracts NLG (Natural Language Generation) content from HTML files for a specific FFT (Fast Free Text) language.
 */
public class DocumentDBPopulate implements DocumentDbGenerator {

    private static Logger logger = Logger.getLogger(DocumentDBPopulate.class);

    /**
     * Generates a DocumentTextsDb object for the given FFT language by scanning resources and walking through each "docs" subdirectory under the specified language directory.
     * @param language The specific FFT language to extract NLG content for.
     * @return A DocumentTextsDb object containing the extracted NLG content.
     * @throws IOException If an I/O error occurs during resource scanning or file reading.
     * @throws URISyntaxException If a malformed URI is encountered during resource scanning.
     */
    public DocumentTextsDb generateFor(FftLanguage language) throws IOException, URISyntaxException {
        DocumentTextsDb db = DocumentTextsDb.createEmpty();

        for (File docsDir : FftScanner.findDocsDirsUnder(language.getLangPath())) {
            extractDocument(docsDir, db);
        }

        return db;
    }

    /**
     * Extracts NLG content from an HTML file for a specific document directory and adds it to the given database.
     * @param docsDir The directory of the document to extract NLG content from.
     * @param db The database to add the extracted NLG content to.
     */
    private static void extractDocument(File docsDir, DocumentTextsDb db) {
        DocumentContent doc = new HtmlTextExtractor().extractFromHtml(new File(docsDir, "index.html"));

        if (doc != null) {
            db.addNlg(docsDir.getName(), doc);
        }
    }

    /**
     * Constructor for DocumentDBPopulate. Initializes the logger for this class using Log4j.
     */
    public DocumentDBPopulate() {}
}
```

## reformulation

The folder `llm-generation/src/main/java/de/semvox/research/predev/cca/llm/text/nlg/reformulation` contains two main files: `ReformulationLLMGenerationService.java` and `UnrecognizedReformulation.java`. These files are part of a larger library that converts FFT (Fault-Finding tree) dialogs into geniOs conversational dialogs. The purpose of this package is to provide a way to generate natural language text from the dialog nodes in the graphml file and handle any unrecognized formulations.

`ReformulationLLMGenerationService.java` is the main class that handles the conversion process. It uses machine learning algorithms to generate natural language text based on the information in the dialog nodes. The service takes a `GraphmlModel` object as input, which represents the FFT dialogs in graphml format, and returns a `List<String>` containing the generated conversational dialogs.

`UnrecognizedReformulation.java` is a class that handles unrecognized formulations in the dialog nodes. If the machine learning algorithm cannot generate a meaningful text for a particular node, it can delegate the responsibility to this class. The `UnrecognizedReformulation` class contains methods to handle different types of unrecognized formulations such as missing information or unrecognized keywords.

To use the library, you would need to create an instance of `ReformulationLLMGenerationService`, passing in a `GraphmlModel` object as a parameter to its constructor. You can then call the `generateConversationalDialogs()` method on the service, which will return a list of generated conversational dialogs.

For example:
```java
GraphmlModel model = new GraphmlModel(); // Load the graphml model containing FFT dialogs
ReformulationLLMGenerationService service = new ReformulationLLMGenerationService(model);
List<String> dialogs = service.generateConversationalDialogs();
```

The library also provides an API for querying the dialog nodes from the graph. You can use the `GraphmlModel` class to retrieve dialog nodes and their properties. For example:
```java
GraphmlModel model = new GraphmlModel(); // Load the graphml model containing FFT dialogs
List<DialogNode> nodes = model.getAllNodes(); // Get all dialog nodes in the graph
for (DialogNode node : nodes) {
    String text = node.getText(); // Get the text of the dialog node
    // Use the text to perform queries or other operations
}
```

In summary, the `llm-generation/src/main/java/de/semvox/research/predev/cca/llm/text/nlg/reformulation` package contains the core functionality for converting FFT dialogs into geniOs conversational dialogs. It provides a service class for generating conversational dialogs and an unrecognized formulation handler. The library also includes an API for querying the dialog nodes from the graph.

## ReformulationLLMGenerationService.java

The `ReformulationLLMGenerationService` class is a component of a system that generates natural language (NLG) based on input text and language. It utilizes an LLM client for processing messages and returns the NLG response as a list of strings. The main constructor initializes the service with an LLM client and an LlmTemplate, which are used to construct and send messages to the LLM model. The `generateNlgFor` method processes text and language information by replacing placeholders in the template, sending it to the LLM client for processing, and returning the NLG from the response. This implementation is part of a larger system that utilizes Large Language Models (LLMs) for NLG generation, with relevant classes and packages available for communication and data handling.

## UnrecognizedReformulation.java

Here is a combined documentation for `UnrecognizedReformulation` class in Java, located at `de.semvox.research.predev.cca.llm.text.nlg.reformulation`. This class reformulates unrecognized NLGs within an NLG database for a specified language using a text generation service:

```java
package de.semvox.research.predev.cca.llm.text.nlg.reformulation;

import de.semvox.research.predev.cca.llm.text.nlg.NlgDB;
import de.semvox.research.predev.cca.llm.text.nlg.TextGenerationService;

public class UnrecognizedReformulation {
    private NlgDB nlgDB;
    private TextGenerationService<String, List<String>> textGenerationService;

    /**
     * Constructs an instance of UnrecognizedReformulation.
     * @param nlgDB The NLG database to be reformulated.
     * @param textGenerationService An implementation of the text generation service used for reformulating NLGs.
     */
    public UnrecognizedReformulation(NlgDB nlgDB, TextGenerationService<String, List<String>> textGenerationService) {
        this.nlgDB = nlgDB;
        this.textGenerationService = textGenerationService;
    }

    /**
     * Reformulates unrecognized NLGs within the specified language and adds them to a new database.
     * @param language The specific language for which to reformulate NLGs.
     */
    public void reformulateUnrecognizedNLGs(String language) {
        // Retrieve unrecognized NLGs from nlgDB for the given language
        List<String> unrecognizedNLGs = nlgDB.getUnrecognizedNLGsForLanguage(language);

        for (String unrecognizedNlg : unrecognizedNLGs) {
            // Generate new NLGs using textGenerationService
            List<String> newNLGs = textGenerationService.generateTexts(unrecognizedNlg);

            // Add the newly formulated NLGs to a new database
            nlgDB.addNLGs(newNLGs);
        }
    }
}
```

This class provides a method `reformulateUnrecognizedNLGs`, which takes a specific language as input, retrieves unrecognized NLGs from the NLG database for that language, reformulates them using the provided text generation service, and adds these newly formulated NLGs to the same or another database.

## llm

The folder "llm-generation/src/main/java/de/semvox/research/predev/cca/llm/text/nlg/llm" contains a single file, NlgGenerationService.java, which is responsible for generating natural language responses from fault finding tree (FFT) dialogs expressed as graphml files. 

The NlgGenerationService class provides methods to convert FFT dialogs into conversational dialogs that can be understood by humans. It uses machine learning algorithms and natural language processing techniques to generate human-like responses based on the content of the dialog nodes in the FFT tree. The generated responses are then expressed as graphml files, which can be used to create a conversation flow that can be queried and manipulated using APIs.

The NlgGenerationService class is designed to work with FFT graphs and generate conversational responses for user interactions. It can handle various types of dialogues, including text-based, voice-based, and visual-based dialogs. By converting FFT dialogs into geniOs conversational dialogs, the project allows for more effective collaboration between human users and systems, enabling better communication and problem resolution.

To use the NlgGenerationService class, developers can create an instance of it and call its methods to generate natural language responses from FFT dialogs expressed as graphml files. The generated responses are then represented as graphml files that can be used to represent a conversational flow.

For example, consider a scenario where a system needs to process fault finding tree (FFT) dialogs expressed as graphml files and generate human-like responses for user interactions. The system can use the NlgGenerationService class to convert FFT dialogs into conversational dialogs that can be used to guide human users through the dialog process. The generated responses can then be presented to users in a natural language format, enabling more effective collaboration between humans and systems.

In summary, the NlgGenerationService class in the folder "llm-generation/src/main/java/de/semvox/research/predev/ccA/llm/text/nlg/llm" is responsible for generating natural language responses from FFT dialogs expressed as graphml files. It provides methods to convert FFT graphs into conversational dialogs that can be understood by humans and used in a conversation flow. The project also provides API for querying the dialog nodes from the graph, which enables better collaboration between human users and systems.

## NlgGenerationService.java

The given Java code file `NlgGenerationService` is part of a Natural Language Generation (NLG) service in a text-based application. The purpose of this class is to generate natural language output from a document content using an LLMClient, which interacts with a large language model.

The NlgGenerationService class implements the TextGenerationService interface and has two private fields:
- `llmClient` (LLMClient<List<String>>): An instance of an LLMClient capable of processing messages to generate text.
- `template` (LlmTemplate): A template used to construct the input message for the large language model.

The constructor initializes the NlgGenerationService with an LLMClient and a LlmTemplate. The method `generateNlgFor` is part of the TextGenerationService interface and takes a DocumentContent object (text) and a FftLanguage object (language) as input. It constructs a message using the given template and replaces placeholders with actual data from the text and language objects, then sends this message to the LLMClient for processing. The response from the client is returned as a list of strings, which represent the generated natural language output.

In summary, the NlgGenerationService class provides a convenient interface for generating natural language text using an LLMClient and LlmTemplate. It can be used in various applications that require NLG functionality, such as content creation assistants or document summarization services.

## changes

The "llm-generation/src/main/java/de/semvox/research/predev/cca/llm/text/nlg/changes" folder in your software project is a part of a larger library that processes and generates natural language text from Fault-Finding tree (FFT) dialogs. The purpose of this package is to handle changes made to the dialog graph, such as removed, added, or changed nodes, which can significantly impact the final conversational text generated from these graphs.

The "RemovedNlg.java" file contains a subclass of AbstractChange that represents a change where a node has been removed from the dialog graph. It provides methods to retrieve the details of the removed node and its associated metadata. The reason for using this class is when you want to generate text from an updated FFT dialog, but also want to know what changes were made since the last time the text was generated.

The "AddedNlg.java" file contains a subclass of AbstractChange that represents a change where a new node has been added to the dialog graph. It provides methods to retrieve the details of the newly added node and its associated metadata. The reason for using this class is when you want to generate text from an updated FFT dialog, but also want to know what changes were made since the last time the text was generated.

The "AbstractChange.java" file contains a base class for all change types that represent modifications to the dialog graph. It provides common properties and methods that are shared by all change types, such as a timestamp of when the change occurred, who made the change, and the specific details of the change (e.g., removed node's id or added node's content).

The "ChangedNlg.java" file contains a subclass of AbstractChange that represents a change where an existing node in the dialog graph has been modified. It provides methods to retrieve the details of the changed node and its associated metadata, as well as the previous state of the node before it was modified. The reason for using this class is when you want to generate text from an updated FFT dialog, but also want to know what changes were made since the last time the text was generated.

In summary, this package contains classes that represent changes made to the dialog graph and provides methods to retrieve details about these changes. This enables the software to track changes in the dialog nodes and generate conversational text from updated FFTs. The library also provides an API for querying the dialog nodes from the graph, allowing users to interact with the FFT data more easily.

## RemovedNlg.java

Package: de.semvox.research.predev.cca.llm.text.nlg.changes

Class Name: RemovedNlg

Responsibility: This class is a subclass of AbstractChange and represents the removal of a value in a Natural Language Generation (NLG) process. It is used to keep track of changes made to text during NLG, which can be useful for debugging or post-processing purposes. The main purpose of this class is to provide a clear and concise way of recording changes made to the text in an NLG system, specifically removing a value from it.

Domain Concept: NLG is a field of computer science that involves creating human-like text using algorithms and models. The RemovedNlg class is part of an NLG system and is used to record the removal of a value from the output text during NLG.

Constructor: `public RemovedNlg(T value)`
This method initializes a new instance of the RemovedNlg class, taking in a generic type T as its parameter, which represents the value that was removed. this value is then passed to the superclass's constructor using `super(value)`.

Combined Documentation: This class is used for recording removal changes in an NLG process, keeping track of all changes made during the generation of text.

## AddedNlg.java

The provided code snippet defines a Java class named `AddedNlg` that extends an abstract base class named `AbstractChange`. This class represents changes made to a value in a text generation process and specifically adds new textual elements (NLG) to a pre-existing document. The `AddedNlg` class has one constructor that takes an object of type T as a parameter, which represents the new NLG that needs to be added to the document.

The `applyChange()` method is overridden in this implementation of `AddedNlg`, which applies the change by simply adding the new NLG to the document. To use this class, you would instantiate it with the new NLG you want to add, then call the `applyChange()` method on an instance of the `Document` class, passing in the `AddedNlg` object as a parameter. This will apply the change to the document and return the modified document.

## AbstractChange.java

The given Java class `AbstractChange` serves as a base for classes representing changes in natural language generation (NLG) operations. This class contains various methods and properties to manipulate and analyze NLG changes. It has the following key responsibilities:

1. Storing the value of the change: The class holds the value which can be of any type due to its generic parameter `T`.
2. Defining whether a change is an addition, removal or change operation: The method `IsChangeOrAddition` checks if the object instance is either an `AddedNlg` or `ChangedNlg`, indicating that it's either an addition or a change in NLG operations.
3. Providing access to the value: It allows external classes to retrieve the value stored within this class.
4. Determining whether a change is removal: The method `IsRemoval` checks if the object instance is an `RemovedNlg`, indicating that it's a removal operation in NLG operations.

The class also includes example usages of the `AbstractChange` class, demonstrating how instances can be created for different types of changes and how to check their types and access the values:

```java
// Creating instances of different types of changes
AddedNlg<String> added = new AddedNlg<>("New item");
ChangedNlg<Integer> changed = new ChangedNlg<>(123, 456);
RemovedNlg<Double> removed = new RemovedNlg<>(3.14);

// Checking the type of change
if (added.IsChangeOrAddition()) {
    System.out.println("This is an addition or a change");
}

// Accessing the value of a changed operation
int oldValue = changed.getValue(); // oldValue will hold 123
double removedNumber = removed.getValue(); // removedNumber will hold 3.14
```

## ChangedNlg.java

The provided Java code file for the "ChangedNlg" class extends an abstract class named "AbstractChange". This class takes a generic type T as a parameter in its constructor, passing this value to its superclass AbstractChange for further processing. The main responsibility of this class lies in handling changes to Natural Language Generation (NLG) text by utilizing all the functionalities provided by the AbstractChange class such as getValue(), setValue() etc. This design allows for a clear separation of concerns and ensures that changes made during NLG generation are properly managed. It's important to note that this class doesn't perform specific operations on the input value, it merely passes it along to its superclass for further processing, which makes it suitable for various use cases where changes need to be tracked and managed in a systematic manner.

## module

The "llm-generation/src/main/java/de/semvox/research/predev/cca/llm/module" folder in this codebase contains several Java classes that are related to generating natural language (NLG) content for a conversational dialog system. These classes play important roles in processing the FFT data and converting it into human-readable conversational dialogs.

1. NlgGenerationModule.java: This class provides functionality for generating NLG content from an input graphml file containing FFT data. It includes methods to parse the graphml file, extract relevant information from the nodes of the graph, and generate NLG sentences based on that information. The NLG sentences can be formatted as either plain text or in a conversational style using natural language processing techniques.

2. NlgReformulationModule.java: this class provides functionality for reformulating existing NLG sentences into new versions that convey the same meaning but have different wording or structure. It includes methods to perform sentiment analysis on the input NLG sentence, identify synonyms and antonyms of words, and generate alternative phrases with similar meanings.

3. LlmModule.java: This class provides a high-level interface for integrating the other modules into the larger conversational dialog system. It includes methods to initialize and run the NLG generation and reformulation processes, as well as to access the output NLG content generated by the previous module.

4. LlmConfig.java: this class contains configuration settings for the NLG generation process. It includes parameters such as the template file used to format the NLG sentences, the maximum length of sentences to generate, and any other relevant options for processing FFT data.

5. MetadataModule.java: This class provides functionality for extracting metadata from the input graphml file that may be useful for generating NLG content. It includes methods to parse the metadata information from the nodes of the graph, perform data analysis on that information, and generate relevant facts or statements based on that data.

Overall, these classes work together to generate human-readable conversational dialogs from input FFT data. The NlgGenerationModule extracts relevant information from the graphml file, reformulates existing NLG sentences, formats them as either plain text or in a conversational style, and stores the resulting NLG content for further processing. The MetadataModule provides additional contextual information that can be used to generate more informative and engaging dialogues. The LlmModule serves as the main entry point for integrating these other modules into the larger system and providing an API for querying the output NLG nodes.

Use cases:
- To convert FFT data into human-readable conversational dialogs, create a new instance of NlgGenerationModule with the appropriate configuration settings, call its run() method to generate NLG content, and store or display the resulting text. You can also use NlgReformulationModule to perform sentiment analysis on existing NLG sentences and generate alternative versions that convey similar meaning.

- To extract additional contextual information from FFT data for generating more informative dialogues, create a new instance of MetadataModule with the appropriate configuration settings, call its run() method to extract metadata, and store or display the resulting facts or statements. You can then use these pieces of information to guide the NlgGenerationModule in generating more engaging and relevant NLG content.

- To query the output NLG nodes from the graph, you can create a new instance of LlmModule with the appropriate configuration settings, call its run() method to generate NLG content, and access or manipulate the resulting text using the NLGNodes API. You can use this API<unused_19>

## fft

The `generation/src/main/java/de/semvox/research/predev/cca/fft` package contains Java classes responsible for converting FFT (Fault-Finding Tree) dialogs into geniOs conversational dialogs. These classes are part of a larger software library designed to assist in generating conversational interfaces from FFT data.

The `FftToConversational.java` class is the entry point for this conversion process. It provides a method called `convert()` that takes an FFT dialog graph as input and returns a geniOs conversational dialog object. This class also includes static methods to convert specific FFT dialogs into geniOs conversational dialogs, such as `convertToGeniosDialog()`, `convertToDtcsDialog()`, etc.

The `FftToConversationalConverter.java` class serves as a middle layer for the conversion process. It contains various methods responsible for transforming the FFT dialog graph into geniOs conversational dialogs. These methods may include manipulating node attributes, adding new nodes or edges to the graph, and removing redundant or unnecessary elements.

In terms of practical examples and use cases, let's consider a scenario where an engineer is developing a tool for generating conversational interfaces from FFT data. The engineer might use the `convert()` method in their application to convert FFT dialogs into geniOs conversational dialogs. For example:
```java
FftToConversational converter = new FftToConversational();
Graph<FFTNode, Edge> fftDialog = // load or create the FFT dialog graph;
ConversationalDialog geniosDialog = converter.convert(fftDialog);
```

The engineer might also use specific conversion methods to convert only certain types of FFT dialogs into geniOs conversational dialogs, such as `convertToGeniosDialog()`. for example:
```java
ConversationalDialog geniosDialog = converter.convertToGeniosDialog(fftDialog);
```

Overall, the purpose and contents of this folder are to provide a library for converting FFT dialogs into geniOs conversational dialogs, along with tools for querying the nodes from the graph. This library will be useful in various applications that require conversational interfaces generated from FFT data.

## FftToConversational.java

```markdown
Package: de.semvox.research.predev.cca.fft

Class Name: FftToConversational

Responsibility: This class provides a utility for converting FFT data into conversational dialogs in the geniOS environment. The purpose of this class is to analyze and understand fault-finding processes in software development.

Constructor:
  FftToConversational(GraphExportService exportService): Initializes an instance of FftToConversational with a properly initialized GraphExportService for converting FFT data into code.

Methods:
  convert() throws FileNotFoundException, FftException: Converts FFT data into conversational dialogs by calling the toConversationalDialogCode() method on the exportService, passing the resulting list of code instances to from(codeList) to create an instance representing a conversation.

Important Concepts Explained:
  FFT (Fault Finding Trees): A popular tool used in software development for identifying and prioritizing issues with the application, often associated with debugging or troubleshooting.
  Graph Export Service: Interface or abstract class responsible for converting FFT data into code that can be used to generate conversations.
  FftException: Custom exception class specific to this application thrown when errors occur during the conversion process.

This utility class is a final class, meaning it cannot be extended by other classes, providing better encapsulation and maintainability of the codebase.
```

## FftToConversationalConverter.java

The `FftToConversationalConverter` interface is responsible for converting FFT dialogs into conversational dialogs suitable for use in conversational systems. The interface defines two methods - `convert()` and the exception classes `FileNotFoundException` and `FftException`.

The `convert()` method is declared to accept no parameters and return an instance of `FftConversationalDialogs`, which represents the converted conversation dialogs. This method initiates the conversion process.

The `FileNotFoundException` exception is thrown when the file containing the FFT dialogs cannot be found, indicating that either the path is incorrect or the file does not exist. Implementers of this interface should handle this exception gracefully to ensure the program can recover from the error and continue operations without crashing.

The `FftException` exception represents any other exceptions specific to the conversion process. It should be handled by the implementers to provide meaningful error messages or take appropriate corrective actions. Implementers need to document what types of errors this exception can throw and how they handle them.

The main goal of implementing this interface is to decouple the FFT dialog conversion logic from any specific conversational system implementation, enabling reusability and future modifications. The interface abstracts away the complexity of the conversion process, allowing for easy integration into various conversational systems without requiring extensive changes in the conversion algorithm or data structures.

## exceptions

The folder generation/src/main/java/de/semvox/research/predev/cca/fft/exceptions is a part of a software development project that deals with converting FFT (Fault-Finding tree) dialogs into geniOs conversational dialogs. It contains the exception class FftException, which is used to handle any exceptions that may occur during this process.

The package de.semvox.research.predev.cca.fft.exceptions provides a way to manage errors and exceptional situations in the FFT-to-geniOs conversion process. It helps maintain the robustness of the software by ensuring that unexpected issues are handled gracefully, allowing the system to continue functioning even when encountering problems.

FftException is a custom exception class that extends the RuntimeException class. This means that it does not need to be caught and handled using try-catch blocks like regular exceptions. Instead, developers can simply throw an instance of FftException whenever they encounter an error or exceptional situation in their code.

For example, if there is an issue with a particular FFT dialog file during the conversion process, developers can create an instance of FftException and include relevant information about the error, such as the filename or the specific step that caused the problem. This exception can then be thrown to the calling code, which can handle it appropriately.

In summary, the purpose of this folder is to provide a robust way to manage errors and exceptional situations in the FFT-to-geniOs conversion process. It allows developers to create custom exceptions that are specific to their application, making it easier to identify and fix issues related to the conversion process. By encapsulating these exceptions in a separate package, they can be easily reused and maintained throughout the project.

## FftException.java

The FftException class is an unchecked exception subclass that extends RuntimeException in Java. It serves as a representation of exceptional situations within the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) module of the application, encapsulating error information and providing constructors for creating instances with or without associated exceptions. The primary responsibility of this class is to indicate exceptional situations during FFT algorithm execution and handle them gracefully by catching these exceptions and providing appropriate feedback or error handling mechanisms.

## output

The folder generation/src/main/java/de/semvox/research/predev/cca/fft/output is part of a software library that converts FFT (Fault-Finding tree) dialogs into geniOs conversational dialogs. The purpose of this package is to provide the functionality for exporting the processed graphml data as conversation format.

1. ImageOutput.java: This class contains methods for converting images from various formats to PNG, JPEG, or BMP. It can be used to generate image files that can be displayed in dialogs or embedded in reports. For example:
```
import de.semvox.research.predev.cca.fft.output.*;

public class ImageExample {
   public static void main(String[] args) {
      ImageOutput image = new ImageOutput();
      image.convertToPNG("path/to/input/file", "output_file_name");
    }
}
```
2. Code.java: this class contains methods for generating code snippets in different programming languages such as Java, Python, C++ etc. It can be used to display source code within dialogs or provide additional information for developers. for example:
```
import de.semvox.research.predev.cca.fft.output.*;

public class CodeExample {
   public static void main(String[] args) {
      Code generator = new Code();
      generator.generateJavaCode("path/to/input/file", "output_file_name");
   }
}
```
3. Output.java: This class contains methods for exporting the processed graphml data as different formats such as XML, JSON or CSV. It can be used to generate files that can be shared with other systems or used in reporting tools. For example:
```
import de.semvox.research.predev.cca.fft.output.*;

public class OutputExample {
   public static void main(String[] args) {
      Output exporter = new Output();
      exporter.exportAsJSON("path/to/input/file", "output_file_name");
   }
}
```
The package also provides an API for querying the dialog nodes from the graph, which can be used to fetch specific information or perform operations on the dialog data. For example:
```
import de.semvox.research.predev.cca.fft.output.*;

public class QueryExample {
   public static void main(String[] args) {
      Graph graph = new Graph();
      Node node = graph.getNodeById("node_id");
      System.out.println(node.getLabel());
   }
}
```

## ImageOutput.java

The `ImageOutput` class in the given software system is part of a larger visualization component, specifically designed for generating images from DOT representations using Graphviz. It encapsulates the process of converting the DOT output into an image file and provides methods to access this functionality.

This class is final, meaning its instances cannot be extended, and it implements the `Output` interface, which presumably contains methods related to data outputs. The constructor initializes three attributes: `output`, `graph`, and `name`. The `graph` attribute holds the rendered Graphviz graph created from the DOT output, while the `output` attribute stores the original DOT representation. The `name` attribute is set based on the file extension of the Graphviz format being used to render the image.

The class provides two constructors: one that takes a DOT output and a Graphviz format as parameters and another that takes an existing `Output` object and an export format. Both constructors delegate to a common constructor that accepts a DOT output and a Graphviz format, allowing for easy initialization based on different inputs.

In addition to these methods, the class also overrides the `getName()` method with the `@Override` annotation, which returns the name of the image file. The `writeTo(Path path)` method writes the image content to the specified file path and throws an `IOException` if there's any input/output error during the process.

In summary, the `ImageOutput` class is a crucial component in generating images from DOT representations using Graphviz within the software system. It encapsulates the rendering of graphs into images and provides methods for accessing the image content and writing it to file paths.

## Code.java

You have provided a documentation for the `Code` class based on the given source code. The purpose of this class is to represent different types of code and provide methods to check whether they are NLG prompts or specifications. This provides an overview of the `Code` class's functionality as well as its utility in handling and categorizing code elements, which can be useful for various programming applications.

## Output.java

The Output interface in the given Java code file provides an interface for creating, retrieving, and manipulating outputs generated from various operations within the program. It defines two abstract methods: getOutput() and getName(). The class "Output" contains default implementations of these methods that need to be overridden by subclasses.

The Output interface includes a static factory method for each type of output: ForJson(), forCode(), of(), and empty(). These methods create instances of a specific output subclass based on the provided input parameters. 

For example, forJson() creates an instance of JSONOutput with the given output content and calls its constructor with the result of ObjectMapper.writeValueAsString() on the provided object as the output. ForCode() creates a TextOutput instance with pretty-printed code content, using the CodePrettyPrinter.prettyPrint() method. of() creates an Output instance based on the specified DOT output and export format. empty() creates an empty Output instance that provides default implementations for getOutput() and getName().

The ImageOutput class extends Output and includes methods to retrieve image data in different formats, such as PNG and SVG. 

The file "generation/src/main/java/de/semvox/research/predev/cca/fft/output/Output.java" defines an interface for outputting data in different formats, including JSON format, code format, and DOT format. This class includes default implementations of the getOutput() and getName() methods that need to be overridden by subclasses. 

The Output class has two abstract methods: getOutput() and getName(). These methods should return the output content and name of the object, respectively. An example implementation of these methods in a subclass could be:
```java
public class TextOutput extends Output {
    private String text;

    // Constructor and other methods...

    @Override
    String getName() {
        return "Text Output";
    }

    @Override
    String getOutput() {
        return text;
    }
}
```
In this example, TextOutput is a subclass of Output that provides the implementation for the getName() and getOutput() methods. The getOutput() method returns the content of the output stored in the 'text' field.

## export

The `generation/src/main/java/de/semvox/research/predev/cca/fft/output/export` folder contains two main classes that are used to export FFT (Fault-Finding tree) dialogs as geniOs conversational dialogs. These classes, `DotDialogExporter` and `Exporter`, serve different purposes but together they work towards the same goal of converting an FFT dialog into a geniOs conversation.

The `Exporter` class is the main class in this package and provides a public static method `exportToGeniosConversation(FFTNode root, String outputFilePath)`. This method takes the root node of the FFT dialog tree and the path to the output file where the geniOs conversation will be saved. The method iterates through each node of the tree and uses other helper methods to convert the nodes into their corresponding geniOs components (e.g., `exportNodeToGeniosComponent(FFTNode node)`). 

The `DotDialogExporter` class provides a `dotifyFFTNodes(List<FFTNode> fftNodes, String outputFilePath)` method which takes a list of FFT nodes and saves them as graphml files. This method is used to visualize the tree structure of an FFT dialog in a human-readable format using the open source tool Graphviz.

The `Exporter` class uses the `DotDialogExporter` to generate dot files for each node in the FFT tree. These dot files can then be converted into graphml files using a separate tool (e.g., DOT). The resulting graphml files represent the FFT dialog tree in a machine-readable format, which can be used by other tools and software libraries.

In summary, the `Exporter` class is responsible for converting an FFT dialog into a geniOs conversation, while the `DotDialogExporter` class is used to generate graphml files representing the tree structure of the FFT dialog. Together, these classes work together to provide a complete solution for exporting FFT dialogs as geniOs conversational dialogs.

## DotDialogExporter.java

The provided Java file `DotDialogExporter` in the package `de.semvox.research.predev.cca.fft.output.export` is designed to export dialog graphs into DOT format, a text-based graph representation language used for visualizing and manipulating graphs. The class implements the `Exporter<String, DialogNode, QAEdge>` interface which allows it to work with graphs of type `Graph<DialogNode, QAEdge>`.

The exporter uses Log4j2 for logging, with a static final variable `LABEL` used as a key when setting node or edge attributes. It contains a logger instance initialized using Log4j2, which is used to log debug information related to the exporter's operations.

The class provides methods `export()`, `vertexProvider()`, and `edgeProvider()` which handle the conversion process of a dialog graph into DOT format. The method `export()` takes a dialog graph as input and returns a string that represents the graph in DOT format using JGraphT library's `DOTExporter`. It sets the identifier for each vertex node, replaces colons with underscores for compatibility with DOT syntax, provides custom attribute providers for nodes and edges, writes the exported graph into a `StringWriter`, which is then returned as a string.

The method `vertexProvider()` returns an implementation of the `AttributeProvider<DialogNode>` interface, which retrieves labels from dialog nodes and constructs DOT-compatible attributes. The method `edgeProvider()` does the same for QAEdges, fetches attributes from edges for the "label" attribute.

The main responsibility of this class is to provide a simple and efficient way to convert a dialog graph into DOT format suitable for visualization or further processing using Graphviz or other tools that support DOT files.

## Exporter.java

```java
package de.semvox.research.predev.cca.fft.output.export;

import org.jgrapht.Graph;

/**
 * This interface defines an exporter for a graph of type Graph<V, E>.
 * Any class that implements this interface must provide a method to export the graph.
 */
public interface Exporter<V, E> {

    /**
     * exports the given graph and returns an object of type T.
     * @param graph The graph to be exported.
     * @return The result of the export operation.
     */
    T export(Graph<V, E> graph);
}
```

## codegeneration

The purpose of the package "generation/src/main/java/de/semvox/research/predev/cca/fft/output/codegeneration" is to generate code based on FFT (Fault-Finding tree) dialogs. This package contains several classes that are used for this purpose, including:

1. BlockBuilder.java: This class is responsible for building code blocks from the FFT nodes. It takes an FFT node as input and produces a CodeBlock object as output.
2. CodeBlock.java: this class represents a block of generated code. It has fields such as type, content, and parent block.
3. AbstractCodeBlock.java: This is an abstract class that serves as the base for all code blocks. It provides common functionality for handling child blocks.
4. FftConversationalDialogs.java: this class takes an input graphml file representing FFT dialogs and generates geniOs conversational dialogs based on it.

The package is part of a library that converts FFT dialogs into geniOs conversational dialogs. The project provides an API for querying the dialog nodes from the graph. This allows users to retrieve information about each node in the dialog tree, such as its type and content. 

Practical examples:
Let's say you have an input FFT dialog represented as a graphml file and you want to generate geniOs conversational dialogs based on it. You can use the following steps:

1. Load the graphml file into the library.
2. Create an instance of FftConversationalDialogs, passing in the loaded graphml file as a parameter.
3. Call the generate method on the FftConversationalDialogs object to generate the conversational dialogs.
4. The generate method will return a list of geniOs conversational dialog objects.

Here's some sample code:

```java
// Load the graphml file into the library
GraphmlFileLoader loader = new GraphmlFileLoader();
List<Graph> graphs = loader.load("input.graphml");

// Create an instance of FftConversationalDialogs
FftConversationalDialogs dialogGenerator = new FftConversationalDialogs(graphs);

// Generate the conversational dialogs
List<GenioConversationalDialog> dialogs = dialogGenerator.generate();
```

Once you have the geniOs conversational dialogs, you can use their API to query information about each node in the dialog tree:

```java
// Retrieve information about a specific node
CodeBlock block = ...; // obtain the CodeBlock object for the desired node
String type = block.getType(); // retrieve the type of the node
String content = block.getContent(); // retrieve the content of the node
AbstractCodeBlock parent = block.getParent(); // retrieve the parent of the node
```

This allows users to manipulate and analyze the generated conversational dialogs in a structured way.

## BlockBuilder.java

The `BlockBuilder` class in the given file is an abstract utility class designed to build sequences of code blocks. It belongs to the package `de.semvox.research.predev.cca.fft.output.codegeneration`, imports necessary classes from standard Java libraries and custom modules, and maintains a list of different types of code blocks. The class provides methods for appending lines or other code blocks to its internal list, building the final string representation, and ensures that unique code blocks are properly handled without duplicate IDs in output.

## CodeBlock.java

The provided code file contains several interfaces, each representing a specific type of block used in a system for generating code. Each interface extends other interfaces and provides methods for their respective functionalities. Here is a detailed explanation of each interface along with its responsibilities:

1. `ReactionContainer` interface: This interface defines a method `react(ReactionReference reactReference)`, which takes an object of type `ReactionReference` as input and returns a value of type `Reaction`. It seems to be responsible for handling and processing reactions in the system.

2. `ReactionReference` interface: this is a subinterface of `OptionChild`, `ReactChild`, and `Reaction`. It likely represents a reference or pointer to a reaction within the system, allowing for interaction between different parts of the code generation process.

3. `ConditionBlock` interface: this extends `CodeBlock`, which seems to be a more general type of block used in conditions. No additional methods or responsibilities are specified here beyond those inherited from `CodeBlock`.

4. `Specification` interface: this also extends `CodeBlock`, representing a specification block within the system. It likely contains rules, constraints, or parameters that define how code should be generated.

5. `SequenceChild` interface: this extends both `CodeBlock` and `ParentTracker`. The `sequenceId()` method is declared to return a string representing the ID of the sequence associated with the block.

6. `ParentTracker` interface: this defines methods for tracking the parent specification. `setParentSpecification(Specification specification)` sets the parent specification, while `getParentSpecification()` returns an optional containing the parent specification if available.

7. `PresentationRequestChild` interface: this is a subinterface of `CodeBlock`, representing a child block used in presentation requests. No additional responsibilities are defined here beyond those inherited from `CodeBlock`.

8. `UniqueBlock` interface: this extends `CodeBlock` and provides a static method `makeUnique(CodeBlock block, String id)`. The purpose of this method is to create a unique block with the given ID, which could be used to identify and manipulate blocks in the system more easily.

In summary, these interfaces serve as blueprints for various types of code blocks within the system, each responsible for specific functionalities such as handling reactions, tracking parent specifications, or defining specifications for code generation. The methods provided by each interface allow for interactions between different parts of the code and facilitate the overall functionality of the code generation process.

The code snippet provided is part of a Java interface and its implementation. The interface defines methods for building blocks of code, returning strings, and retrieving the unique identifier (ID) of each block. Let's analyze this interface and its implementation:

Interface CodeBlock:
The `CodeBlock` interface contains three methods: 

1. `void build()`: this method is used to construct or initialize the block. In the given code, it calls the `build()` method on the `block` instance which seems to be another `CodeBlock` object.

2. `String buildString()`: This method returns a string representation of the block. In the given code, it just delegates the call to the `buildString()` method of `block`.

3. `String id()`: This is an abstract method that needs to be implemented by concrete classes of `CodeBlock` interface. It returns the unique identifier (ID) of the block.

Implementation of CodeBlock Interface:
The implementation of `CodeBlock` interface is done within a nested anonymous class, which overrides all the three methods defined in the interface.

```java
return new CodeBlock() {
    // Implementing the CodeBlock interface
    @Override
    public void build() {
        block.build();
    }

    @Override
    public String buildString() {
        return block.buildString();
    }

    @Override
    public String id() {
        return id;
    }
};
```

In the implementation, we return a new instance of `CodeBlock` that overrides all methods of the interface. The overridden `id()` method simply returns the value stored in the `id` variable, which is assumed to be initialized somewhere else before this code block.

In summary, the `CodeBlock` interface defines basic operations for building and managing code blocks. The implementation uses an anonymous nested class to extend the interface and provides concrete implementations of its methods. The `id()` method should be implemented by any class that implements `CodeBlock`, providing a unique identifier for each instance of the block.

## AbstractCodeBlock.java

The Java class `de.semvox.research.predev.cca.fft.output.codegeneration.AbstractCodeBlock` is a part of a software system that creates and manipulates strings representing code snippets for various programming languages, such as Java or Python. It provides several methods for appending different types of elements to the generated code. 

Here is a brief overview of each method:

1. `appendList(List<String> values)`: This method takes a list of string values and appends them within square brackets. The values are converted to strings enclosed in quotes (e.g., ["value1", "value2", "value3"]). After appending the list, it also calls the `appendNewLine()` method to add a new line after the list.

2. `appendNewLine()`: this method simply appends a new line character (`\n`) to the generated code.

3. `appendThing(Thing thing)`: This method takes an object of type `Thing` and appends it as a semantic object (represented by the string returned by the `asSemObject()` method of the `Thing` class).

4. `appendWithDollar(String name)`: this method appends a dollar sign (`$`) followed by the given variable name. It is often used to denote variables or identifiers in code.

5. `appendWithDollarAndOpenBraces(String name)`: This method calls `appendWithDollar(name)` and then appends an opening brace (`{`) to start a new block of code, followed by a new line break.

6. `appendStringsWithinParenthesis(String... text)`: this is a varargs version of the previous method, which takes a variable number of string arguments and appends them within parentheses. It calls the List-based version of this method internally to convert the array of strings into a list before processing.

7. `appendStringsWithinParenthesis(List<String> texts)`: This method takes a list of strings, converts each string to be enclosed in quotes (e.g., ["text1", "text2"]), and appends them within parentheses. It then returns the current instance of `AbstractCodeBlock`.

8. `appendStringsWithinParenthesisWithoutQuotes(List<String> texts)`: this method takes a list of strings, joins them with spaces as separators, and appends them within parentheses without enclosing each string in quotes. It then returns the current instance of `AbstractCodeBlock`.

Overall, this class provides a flexible way to generate code snippets by appending different types of elements such as lists, things, dollar signs, and strings within parentheses. The methods are designed to be easily reused across different parts of an application that generates code.

## FftConversationalDialogs.java

This Java code defines a class `FftConversationalDialogs` within the package `de.semvox.research.predev.cca.fft.output.codegeneration`. It represents a collection of conversational dialogues, including a main dialog and subdialogs. The class provides methods to interact with this collection, such as retrieving the main dialog, subdialogs, or specific types of dialogues/specs. The primary purpose of this class is to organize and manage conversations based on their content, making it easier to work with and manipulate collections of conversation data in Java applications.

## conversationdsl

The folder generation/src/main/java/de/semvox/research/predev/cca/fft/output/codegeneration/conversationdsl contains two main files: ConversationalCodeBlocks.java and OperationsConversationHelper.java. These files play a crucial role in the conversational code generation process and provide essential functionalities for converting FFT dialogs into geniOs conversational dialogs.

        System.out.println(code);  // Output: "John Doe"
    }
}
```

## OperationsConversationHelper.java

The provided Java code file `OperationsConversationHelper` belongs to the package `de.semvox.research.predev.cca.fft.output.codegeneration.conversationdsl`. This package contains utility functions for generating conversational code blocks in the Conversational DSL format used for building dialog interactions. The class is a singleton that provides a method `buildOperations()` which returns a conversation object with specific operations defined in it. These operations include starting an interaction, updating turn IDs, and ending a turn, all of which are performed using utility classes such as `ThingWriter`. The purpose of this class is to help build and manage different types of conversational interactions within the system.

## spec

The `SpecCodeBlocks` class in the `de.semvox.research.predev.cca.fft.output.codegeneration.spec` package is a utility class designed to generate code based on FFT (Fault-Finding tree) dialogs expressed as graphml files. Its main purpose is to help automate the process of converting these FFT dialogs into geniOs conversational dialogs.

The `SpecCodeBlocks` class provides two main functionalities:
1. **GraphML Parsing**: It includes a method `parseFftDialogFromGraphml` which takes the path to a graphml file representing an FFT dialog as input and returns an object of type `FftDialog`. This parsed data can be then used for further operations or analysis.

2. **Code Generation**: Another key functionality is the `generateConversationalDialog` method, which takes an instance of `FftDialog` as input along with some additional parameters (such as dialog context) and generates a conversational dialog in geniOs format. This generated conversation can then be used to interact with users or further analyze the dialog content.

The purpose of this package is to provide a straightforward way for developers working on the project to integrate FFT dialog processing into their software. By using the `SpecCodeBlocks` class, software engineers can focus on developing their own application logic and not worry about the details of FFT dialog parsing or code generation.

Practical Examples:
1. Suppose you have a graphml file representing an FFT dialog, and you want to convert it into a conversational dialog in geniOs format. You can do this by following these steps:
   - Load the graphml file using `SpecCodeBlocks` class's `parseFftDialogFromGraphml` method.
   - Then use the parsed data to generate the conversational dialog using `generateConversationalDialog` method of `SpecCodeBlocks` class, providing any necessary parameters such as dialog context.

2. Another example is when you need to query or analyze the nodes in an FFT dialog from its graphml representation. You can use the `parseFftDialogFromGraphml` method to obtain an instance of `FftDialog`, which can then be used for various data analysis operations.

Important: The usage of this package assumes a strong understanding of FFT dialogs and graphml files, as well as conversational dialogs in geniOs format. For further information on how the project works or how to use it effectively, consult the comprehensive documentation or contact the project's maintainers for assistance.

## SpecCodeBlocks.java

The given Java code snippet is part of a larger system that defines classes for generating specifications in a conversational AI model. The main responsibility of these classes is to build sequences of various types (e.g., free text, matches) in a structured format.

1. `SpecCodeBlocks`: This class contains two static nested classes (`FreeText` and `Match`) that represent specific types of code blocks. Each class extends the abstract class `AbstractCodeBlock`, which provides common behavior for all code block types. The main method `addSequence()` takes a variable number of child elements (either `SequenceChild` or `SpecConversation`), creates a new sequence, adds all given children to it, and then appends this sequence to the parent specification.

2. `Sequence`: this class represents a sequence of code blocks. It has a list of `SequenceChild` objects as its children and provides methods to add, remove, and iterate over these children. The `add()` method adds a child to the sequence and sets its parent specification to the current sequence. The `build()` method constructs the representation of this sequence in the target language (in this case, it generates a string representation with brackets), using the common `appendWithOpenBracket()`, `appendBlocks()`, and `appendCloseBracket()` methods from the `AbstractCodeBlock` class. There are also methods to add multiple child elements (`addAll()` method variants) or to check if a child sequence with a given ID exists (`hasChildWithId()` method).

In summary, the code defines two classes that facilitate building sequences of specifications for AI models, using various types of code blocks such as free text and matches. The `SpecCodeBlocks` class contains nested static classes for specific types of code blocks, which are then used to construct sequences in a structured manner. The `Sequence` class represents a sequence of code blocks and provides methods for adding, removing, and iterating over its children.

In this Java code snippet, we have a class structure for generating specifications of conversations in a text-based context. The `SpecCodeBlocks` class is the main class that contains two subclasses: `OneOf` and `Conversation`.

The `OneOf` class represents a group of conversations where only one conversation should be selected at random from the group. It maintains a list of `SpecConversation` objects, which are specifications for individual conversations. The `build()` method is responsible for generating the code block representation of the `OneOf` specification by appending the opening bracket "one-of", followed by All the `SpecConversation` blocks enclosed in curly braces, and finally the closing bracket.

The `toString()` method provides a string representation of the `OneOf` object including its list of `SpecConversation` objects.

To add a conversation to the `OneOf`, we use the `addConversation(SpecConversation conversation)` method, which appends the given `SpecConversation` to the list and returns the current instance of `OneOf` for chaining purposes.

The `Conversation` class is another subclass that represents a single conversation specification. It has a single attribute `responses`, which is a list of strings representing possible responses in the conversation. The `build()` method generates code blocks for each response and appends them to the current object, while the `toString()` method provides a string representation of the `Conversation` object including its list of responses.

## things

The folder "generation/src/main/java/de/semvox/research/predev/cca/fft/output/codegeneration/things" contains Java classes related to generating code for interacting with things in a conversational environment. These classes are used to convert FFT dialogs into geniOs conversational dialogs, which is an open-source platform for building conversational interfaces.

UpdateInteractionThing.java: This class represents an update interaction thing and provides methods for updating the state of a thing. It is used when a user performs an action that changes the state of a thing.

StartInteractionThing.java: this class represents a start interaction thing, which is used when a new thing needs to be started or initialized.

StringBindingWithVariable.java: This class provides methods for binding variables to strings. It can be useful in scenarios where you need to generate dynamic content based on user input or other data.

EndTurnThing.java: This class represents an end turn thing, which is used when the current interaction with a thing is complete.

The package is designed to help developers build conversational interfaces that can interact with things in real-time. By using these classes, developers can generate code that will allow for smooth integration of FFT dialogs into geniOs conversational dialogs. The classes also provide methods for querying the dialog nodes from the graph, which can be useful in scenarios where you need to analyze or manipulate the dialog data programmatically.

Practical examples:
1. Suppose you have a smart home system that allows users to control various devices. You want to create an FFT dialog that allows users to turn on or off a light using voice commands. To do this, you can use the StartInteractionThing class to start the interaction with the light and the UpdateInteractionThing class to update its state based on the user's command.
2. Suppose you have a travel app that allows users to book flights, hotels, and other travel-related services. You want to create an FFT dialog that allows users to search for nearby restaurants using voice commands. To do this, you can use the StringBindingWithVariable class to bind the user's location to the search query, and then use the UpdateInteractionThing class to update the list of restaurants returned by the search.

## UpdateInteractionThing.java

The given Java code snippet defines a class `UpdateInteractionThing` that implements an interface `Thing`. This class is part of a larger system for generating code in the framework of the "Flexible Forward Thinking (FFT)" research project. It's responsible for creating objects that represent updates to interactions between users and systems.

The `UpdateInteractionThing` class has two private fields:
1. `userTurnId` (String): Holds the unique identifier of a user's turn in the interaction.
2. `systemTurnId` (String): Holds the unique identifier of the system's turn in the interaction.

The constructor `UpdateInteractionThing(String userTurnId, String systemTurnId)` initializes these fields with the provided values. 

The method `AsSemObject()` is overridden and returns a string representation of an object in the Semantic Web (SW) format. The output string includes properties for the user's dialog id (`fft#userDialogId`) and the system's dialog id (`fft#systemDialogId`).

In the `AsSemObject()` method, it creates instances of a class `StringBindingWithVariable` to bind the respective identifiers with their respective property names.

Overall, this class plays an essential role in generating and representing updates to interactions between users and systems, which are crucial for the FFT research project's forward-thinking approach.

## StartInteractionThing.java

The code file `StartInteractionThing` is located in the "generation" module of the Java project. It is responsible for creating representations of interactions between users and systems. The class implements the `Thing` interface and represents an interaction that starts in a dialog.

Instance variables `dialogId`, `userTurnId`, and `systemTurnId` store the respective IDs for the current dialog, user turn, and system turn, which are passed to the constructor when creating a new object of this class.

The `AsSemObject()` method returns a string representation of an interaction in a specific format. It includes properties (like conversationId, userDialogId, and systemDialogId) that describe the interaction. Each property is enclosed within curly braces and contains a value obtained from a `StringBindingWithVariable` object.

The variable `CLOSE_CURLY` stores the string "}". It is used to close each property section in the output string.

This class can be used in various parts of the project where interactions need to be represented semantically, for example as input for further processing in another module.

## StringBindingWithVariable.java

Java class `StringBindingWithVariable` implements the interface `Thing`, and provides a way to generate code for creating objects with a string variable as a property or attribute. The class has one constructor that takes a single string parameter, representing the variable to be bound to the object. The `AsSemObject` method returns a string representation of the object in a specific format, which includes the name of the object and its property set to the provided variable. This can be useful for integrating generated code into existing systems with a particular naming convention.

## EndTurnThing.java

The provided code defines a Java class named `EndTurnThing` which implements an interface `Thing`. The main purpose of this class is to generate an SEM (Structured English Model) object that represents the end turn in a conversation system. This class has two instance variables, `userTurnId` and `systemTurnId`, which hold unique identifiers for user and system turns respectively.

The class provides a constructor that initializes these identifiers when creating an instance of `EndTurnThing`. The main functionality of this class is encapsulated in its method `AsSemObject()`, which returns a string representing the SEM object for the end turn.

To create and use instances of `EndTurnThing`, one would need to pass the necessary identifiers to the constructor and then call the `AsSemObject()` method on this instance. The returned string can be further processed or integrated with other parts of a conversation system that utilize SEM objects for model-based processing or analysis.

The code also references an unspecified class named `StringBindingWithVariable`, which is used to handle variables within strings. It's important to note that without more information about this class, it's unclear what its purpose is and how it can be utilized in the provided code.

## utils

The `generation/src/main/java/de/semvox/research/predev/cca/fft/output/codegeneration/utils` folder contains two Java classes: ThingWriter and CodePrettyPrinter. These are utility classes that play a crucial role in the generation of code from FFT dialogs to geniOs conversational dialogs.

ThingWriter.java is responsible for converting FFT nodes into Thing objects, which are used as building blocks for creating geniOs conversational dialogs. It takes an FFT node as input and extracts relevant information (e.g., textual content, attributes) from it to create a Thing object with the same properties.

CodePrettyPrinter.java is a utility class responsible for formatting and printing generated code. It provides methods for indenting, wrapping lines, and adding comments to the code. This class helps maintain code readability and cleanliness by ensuring that the generated code is neatly organized and formatted according to best practices.

In terms of usage, these classes are crucial in the process of converting FFT dialogs into geniOs conversational dialogs. The ThingWriter class is used to convert FFT nodes into Thing objects, which can then be added to a conversational dialog object. This ensures that the generated code accurately represents the original dialog structure and content.

The CodePrettyPrinter class is also essential for generating readable and well-formatted code. It helps maintain consistency and adherence to best practices in coding style and formatting, making it easier for others to understand and maintain the generated code.

In practical use cases, consider a scenario where you need to convert an FFT dialog into geniOs conversational dialogs. The first step would be to parse the graphml file containing the FFT dialog data using an appropriate parser. Once parsed, each node in the FFT dialog can be processed by the ThingWriter class to create corresponding Thing objects. These Thing objects can then be added to a conversational dialog object, which is finally converted into geniOs code using the CodePrettyPrinter class.

Overall, the `generation/src/main/java/de/semvox/research/predev/cca/fft/output/codegeneration/utils` package provides essential utility classes for generating code from FFT dialogs to geniOs conversational dialogs. These classes work together to ensure that the generated code accurately represents the original dialog structure and content, while also maintaining readability and consistency in formatting.

## ThingWriter.java

The given Java code file contains utility classes for generating Things in a specific format related to interactions in an IM system. The `ThingWriter` class provides static methods to create different types of Things, while the subclasses (StartInteractionThing, UpdateInteractionIdsThing, EndTurnThing) represent specific interaction types with their own constructors and methods.

The main functionality lies in the utility class `ThingWriter`, which contains a method `generateShowPictogram` to create a Thing object representing a show pictogram event. This method takes a document ID (docId) and images as input, constructs the necessary structure for the Thing, and returns its string representation. The helper function `createImageObject` is used by `generateShowPictogram` to create individual image objects for each image URL provided.

Additionally, the classes StartInteractionThing, UpdateInteractionIdsThing, and EndTurnThing are subclasses of Thing, with their own constructors to represent specific types of interactions. They take user turn IDs and system turn IDs as input and return instances of these interaction types in a string format.

Overall, this code file provides the necessary tools for generating and manipulating Things related to interactions between humans and systems, allowing for effective representation and analysis of dialogical data.

## CodePrettyPrinter.java

The `CodePrettyPrinter` class is a utility tool designed to format code in a structured and readable manner. It contains two main methods - `convertCodeToLines()` and `indentCodeLines()`. The former converts the input code into individual lines, while the latter indents those lines based on their structure. The pretty-printed output is then generated by calling the primary method `prettyPrint()`, which first prepares the code for pretty printing, and finally joins all lines with line separators to form a final string.

The `convertCodeToLines()` method splits the input code into individual lines using the system's line separator and trims any leading or trailing whitespace from each line before adding it to the list of lines. The `indentCodeLines()` method takes these lines and applies proper indentation based on curly braces, ensuring that blocks are correctly indented within the code structure.

The class utilizes a stack-based approach to manage the current indentation level, with every opening curly brace increasing the level by one tab and every closing curly brace decreasing it. The `prettyPrint()` method first converts the input code into lines and then uses these lines to generate a properly indented version of the code.

The provided Java class is located in the package `de.semvox.research.predev.cca.fft.output.codegeneration.utils`, where it serves as a utility for formatting and organizing code. The `CodePrettyPrinter` class has methods to convert and indent code, as well as a helper method to manage the current indentation level.

## common

This package has the following main functions:

1. Parsing: The CommonCodeBlocks class provides methods to parse and convert FFT nodes into graphml nodes.
2. Translation: It also includes methods for translating the parsed data into conversational dialogs using specific templates.
3. Generation: Finally, it contains methods for generating code from the translated dialogs which can be used to create conversations in an application or software environment.

Practical examples of how to use this class include:

- Parsing FFT nodes into graphml nodes: For instance, you may have an FFT node representing a user query. You would need to convert this node into a graphml node using the CommonCodeBlocks.parseNode method.

```
FFTNode fftNode = ... // create your own FFT node
GraphMLNode graphmlNode = CommonCodeBlocks.parseNode(fftNode);
```

- Translating parsed data into conversational dialogs: Once you have the graphml nodes, you can use the CommonCodeBlocks class to translate them into conversational dialogs using specific templates. For example, let's say you want to convert a FFT node representing an error message into a conversational dialog:

```
GraphMLNode graphmlNode = ... // get your graphml node from somewhere
ConversationalDialog dialog = CommonCodeBlocks.translateToDialog(graphmlNode);
```

- Generating code from the translated dialogs: Finally, you can use the CommonCodeBlocks class to generate code from the converted dialogs which can be used to create conversations in an application or software environment.

```
ConversationalDialog dialog = ... // get your dialog node from somewhere
String code = CommonCodeBlocks.generateCode(dialog);
```

In summary, this package is designed to help developers quickly convert FFT dialogs into geniOs conversational dialogs. The CommonCodeBlocks class provides methods for parsing and translating the data using specific templates, which can be used to generate code that can be used to create conversations in an application or software environment.

        }

        public static LanguageBlock languageBlock(String text, String language) {
            return new LanguageBlock(text, language);
        }

        public static LanguageBlock languageBlock(List<String> texts, String language) {
            return new LanguageBlock(texts, language);
        }
    }
}
```

## nlgprompt

The folder generation/src/main/java/de/semvox/research/predev/cca/fft/output/codegeneration/nlgprompt contains Java code that generates natural language prompts based on fault-finding tree dialogs. The NlgPromptsCodeBlocks class is the main class of this package and is responsible for processing the FFT dialogs and generating NLG (Natural Language Generation) prompts.

The NlgPromptsCodeBlocks class has several methods that can be used to generate NLG prompts from an FFT graphml file:
- `generateNlgPrompt(File fftFile, boolean includeInstructionNodes)`: This method reads the FFT dialog from the given graphml file and generates an NLG prompt based on the instructions and questions in the dialog. If `includeInstructionNodes` is set to `true`, it will include any instruction nodes in the prompt generation process.
- `generateNlgPrompt(FaultFindingTree fft)`: this method takes a FFT object as input and generates an NLG prompt based on its instructions and questions.

The NlgPromptsCodeBlocks class also has some utility methods that can be used to convert the FFT dialog into different formats:
- `convertToGraphml(FaultFindingTree fft, File graphmlFile)`: this method takes a FFT object as input and converts it into a GraphML file.

In addition to generating NLG prompts, the NlgPromptsCodeBlocks class also provides an API for querying the dialog nodes from the graph. The `getDialogNodes()` method returns a list of all dialog nodes in the FFT, while the `getNodeById(int id)` method returns a specific dialog node based on its ID.

Overall, the NlgPromptsCodeBlocks class provides a complete solution for generating NLG prompts from FFT dialogs and querying the dialog nodes from the graph. These functionalities are useful in various applications such as fault finding tree analysis, conversation agent development, and natural language processing.

## NlgPromptsCodeBlocks.java

This Java class `NlgPromptsCodeBlocks` is part of a natural language processing application that generates prompts for text generation tasks. The main functionality provided includes creating and manipulating NLG prompt code blocks, such as empty, simple, and complex prompts, as well as sanitizing prompt names. Additionally, it supports grouping related prompts together and generating code blocks for the entire set of prompts.

The `NlgPromptsCodeBlocks` class offers various static methods for creating prompt code blocks including empty ones, prompts with a single or multiple versions, and sanitized prompt names. The inner class `Prompts` facilitates grouping related prompts under a common name by providing methods to add prompt code blocks and generate all related NLG prompts as code blocks.

The `PromptCodeBlock` class encapsulates an individual prompt with its details such as name, language, and text. It allows creating instances of `PromptCodeBlock` with custom prefixes, names, languages, and texts, which can be used to generate code blocks for each individual prompt. The `build()` method generates the code block representation of a prompt by appending it with spaces, brackets, and other necessary formatting.

Overall, this class provides a convenient and structured way to manage natural language prompts used in text generation tasks, offering utilities for creating, grouping, and sanitizing prompt names, as well as generating code blocks for the entire collection of prompts.

## dialoggraph

The "generation/src/main/java/de/semvox/research/predev/cca/fft/dialoggraph" folder contains the Java source code for a software component responsible for exporting Fault-Finding tree (FFT) dialogs as graphml files into conversational dialogs in GENIOS format. The GraphExportService class serves as the primary entry point for this functionality, and it provides methods to perform the conversion process.

GENIOS is a standard format for representing conversational dialogs used in enterprise software development projects. The purpose of the "fft/dialoggraph" folder is to provide tools and libraries that enable seamless integration between FFT dialog analysis and GENIOS conversational dialog representation, enabling more effective collaboration among developers, quality assurance engineers, and end-users.

The GraphExportService class serves as an interface for converting FFT dialogs into GENIOS format by utilizing predefined templates and algorithms. The main functionality of this class is encapsulated within the "convert" method, which takes a String input representing the FFT dialog in graphml format and returns a String output representing the corresponding GENIOS conversational dialog in XML format.

The GraphExportService class also includes other helper methods for parsing and manipulating the FFT dialog data, as well as providing query functionality for extracting specific nodes or components from the graph representation of the dialog.

To use the GraphExportService class effectively, developers can follow these general steps:

1. Create an instance of GraphExportService using the appropriate constructor that takes necessary configuration parameters.
2. Call the "convert" method with a String input representing the FFT dialog in graphml format.
3. The method will return a String output representing the GENIOS conversational dialog in XML format, which can be further processed or integrated into the overall system.

Here is an example use case of the GraphExportService class:

Suppose we have an instance of the GraphExportService called "fftConverter" and we want to convert a sample FFT dialog stored as a graphml file into GENIOS format:

```java
GraphExportService fftConverter = new GraphExportService(/* pass necessary configuration parameters */);

String fftDialogGraphmlInput = /* read the content of the graphml file */;
String ggeniosOutput = fftConverter.convert(fftDialogGraphmlInput);

// Now, you can use or further process the GENIOS output as needed
```

In this example, we first create an instance of GraphExportService with appropriate configuration parameters, then read the content of the FFT dialog graphml file into a String variable, and finally call the "convert" method to perform the conversion. The resulting GENIOS conversational dialog is stored in a String variable, which can be further used or processed as needed for further steps in the project.

Overall, the GraphExportService class provides a powerful toolset for converting FFT dialogs into GENIOS format, enabling seamless integration with other components of the system and promoting effective collaboration among developers, quality assurance engineers, and end-users.

## GraphExportService.java

The `GraphExportService` class is part of a larger system for generating conversational dialog graphs and exporting them in various formats. It provides methods for handling the graph traversal logic, generating conversational dialog code from the graph, and listing sub-diagnoses present in the graph. The class has main responsibilities such as dialog graph export, code generation, and sub-diagnosis listing. To use this class effectively, an instance of it with a list of `GraphTraverse` objects and the dialog graph should be created. For example:

```java
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.Arrays;
import java.util.List;
import org.jgrapht.graph.DefaultEdge;
import org.jgrapht.Graph;
import org.jgrapht.graph.SimpleDirectedGraph;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Create a dialog graph
        Graph<DialogNode, DefaultEdge> dialogGraph = new SimpleDirectedGraph<>();
        dialogGraph.addVertex(new DialogNode("1"));
        dialogGraph.addVertex(new DialogNode("2"));
        dialogGraph.addVertex(new DialogNode("3"));
        dialogGraph.addEdge(new DialogNode("1"), new DialogNode("2"));
        dialogGraph.addEdge(new DialogNode("2"), new DialogNode("3"));

        // Create a list of graph traversers for code generation
        List<GraphTraverse> graphTraverseList = new ArrayList<>();
        graphTraverseList.add(new GraphTraverse()); // Example graph traverser object

        // Create an instance of GraphExportService
        GraphExportService graphExportService = new GraphExportService(graphTraverseList, dialogGraph);

        // Export the dialog graph to DOT format
        Output dotOutput = graphExportService.toDot();
        System.out.println("DOT export: " + dotOutput.getContent());

        // List sub-diagnoses in the dialog graph
        List<Subdiagnosis> subDiagnoses = graphExportService.listSubDiagnoses();
        System.out.println("Sub-diagnoses: " + Arrays.toString(subDiagnoses.toArray()));
    }
}
```

In the example above, we first create a simple dialog graph using JGraphT's `SimpleDirectedGraph`. Then, we define a list of graph traversers for code generation and finally, we create an instance of `GraphExportService` with our dialog graph and graph traverser list. We then use this service to export the dialog graph to DOT format and list the sub-diagnoses present in the graph. The class contains methods such as `toConversationalDialogCode()`, `toImage(Path outputPath, ExportFormat format)`, `toJson(Path outputPath)`, and `listSubDiagnosis()` that handle various functionalities related to generating conversational dialog code or images from a dialog graph.

## visitors

The package generation/src/main/java/de/semvox/research/predev/cca/fft/dialoggraph/visitors contains two main classes: VisitorContext and AbstractVisitorWithDocument.

VisitorContext is a class that serves as the context for visiting the nodes in the FFT dialog graph. It maintains information about the current node being visited, such as its type, properties, and relationships with other nodes. The context also provides methods for accessing the document or model to which the dialog belongs, and for creating new nodes or edges.

AbstractVisitorWithDocument is an abstract class that defines common functionality for visiting the nodes in the FFT dialog graph. Subclasses of this class can override specific visit methods to customize their behavior when visiting different types of nodes. For example, a visitor class could be designed to extract information about all nodes with a certain type from the graph, or to perform some transformation on the graph.

The main purpose of these classes is to provide an organized and structured way for traversing the FFT dialog graph and performing operations on its nodes. By encapsulating this functionality in a separate package, it makes it easier for other developers to use and contribute to the project without having to worry about the details of how the graph is represented or manipulated.

To use these classes, you would create an instance of the appropriate subclass of AbstractVisitorWithDocument, passing in any necessary parameters (such as the document or model) at construction time. Then, you can call the visit method on the visitor class to traverse the graph and perform the desired operations on its nodes.

Here is a simple example of how you might use these classes to extract information about all nodes with a certain type from the FFT dialog graph:

```java
// Create an instance of NodeInfoVisitor, passing in the document or model as a parameter
NodeInfoVisitor visitor = new NodeInfoVisitor(document);

// Traverse the graph and perform the desired operations on its nodes
for (Node node : graph.getNodes()) {
    visitor.visit(node);
}

// Retrieve the information extracted by the visitor from the context object
List<String> nodeNames = visitor.getNodeNames();
```

In this example, NodeInfoVisitor is a subclass of AbstractVisitorWithDocument that overrides the visit method to extract the name of each node and store it in a list. The getNodeNames method returns the list of node names extracted by the visitor.

## VisitorContext.java

The Java class `de.semvox.research.predev.cca.fft.dialoggraph.visitors.VisitorContext` is designed to manage and manipulate context during the visit process of objects within a dialog graph-based structure, particularly in the context of dialog graph processing. The purpose of this class is to encapsulate information necessary for visiting each node of a dialog graph and ensure that visitor functions have access to all the relevant data they need during their execution.

This utility class has several key aspects:
1. **Static Method `forSpec`**: This method creates a new instance of `VisitorContext` specifically tailored for processing specifications. It takes a single parameter, `specName`, which represents the name of the specification being handled. Inside the method, it calls another static method (`newScenario`) from the `SpecCodeBlocks` class to generate a scenario code block based on the given specification name and initializes a new instance of `VisitorContext` with this scenario code block and the specified `specName`.

```java
public static VisitorContext forSpec(String specName) {
    return new VisitorContext(SpecCodeBlocks.newScenario(specName), specName);
}
```

2. **Constructor**: The constructor of `VisitorContext` initializes the class with two parameters: `scenario` (an instance representing a scenario code block) and `specName` (the name of the specification being handled). this constructor is private, ensuring that instances can only be created through the static method `forSpec`.

```java
private VisitorContext(CodeBlock scenario, String specName) {
    this.scenario = scenario;
    this.specName = specName;
}
```

3. **Private Instance Variables**: The class includes two private instance variables, `scenario` and `specName`, both of which are used to store the corresponding data related to the context during a visit process.

Overall, this utility class serves as an abstraction layer for managing context-dependent operations in dialog graph processing. It provides a structured way to encapsulate and manage the necessary information for visiting each node of the graph while ensuring that the visitor functions have access to all required data for their execution. The static method `forSpec` facilitates creating instances of `VisitorContext` tailored specifically to the task of handling specifications, making it a versatile tool in dialog graph processing scenarios.

## AbstractVisitorWithDocument.java

In this Java file, we have an abstract class named AbstractVisitorWithDocument located in the package de.semvox.research.predev.cca.fft.dialoggraph.visitors. This class serves as a base for visiting nodes in a dialog graph and building reactions based on the understood information. It provides core functionality such as NLG content retrieval, image URL retrieval, understanding block construction, and conversational state-based reaction creation.

The AbstractVisitorWithDocument has two protected methods: createReactionBuilderForState(ConversationalState) and buildUnderstandReaction(String understandName, DialogNode node, String[] ThenUnderstandNames, Edge link, Map<String, Object> context). The former creates an instance of AbstractReactionBuilder based on the provided conversational state, while the latter builds a reaction for understanding operations.

The subclasses of AbstractVisitorWithDocument must implement these abstract methods to provide specific behavior for each type of reaction they support.

## dispatcher

The folder generation/src/main/java/de/semvox/research/predev/cca/fft/dialoggraph/visitors/internal/dispatcher contains Java classes that are responsible for traversing the FFT dialog graph and executing visitor patterns. These classes are used to perform operations on the nodes of the graph in a specific order, without modifying the original graph structure.

Visitors.java: This class provides an interface for visitors to implement. Each visitor should have a visit method for each type of node in the graph. When a traversal is performed using a DfsVisitorDispatcher instance, it will call the appropriate visit method for each node it encounters.

DfsVisitorDispatcher.java: this class implements the Dispatch interface and provides methods for performing depth-first search (DFS) on the graph. It maintains a stack of nodes to explore next, and calls the appropriate visit method for each node as it is encountered.

GraphTraverse.java: This class contains methods for traversing the FFT dialog graph using different algorithms such as DFS, BFS, or A*. These methods create a new instance of DfsVisitorDispatcher and use it to perform the traversal.

Overall, these classes are used to implement the Visitor pattern for traversing the FFT dialog graph. The Visitors interface defines what each visitor should do, and the DfsVisitorDispatcher class implements a specific algorithm for traversing the graph. The GraphTraverse class is a utility class that provides methods for performing different types of traversals on the graph.

Here's an example use case:

Suppose you have a FFT dialog graph representing a conversation between two people, and you want to extract all the messages from the graph. You can create a new class that implements the Visitors interface, providing a visit method for each type of node in the graph. In your visit method, you would check the type of node and extract any relevant information (such as the message text).

Then, you can create an instance of DfsVisitorDispatcher and use it to perform a depth-first search on the graph, calling your visitor's visit method for each node. The resulting messages would be collected in a list or other data structure, which could then be returned by your method.

This approach allows you to decouple different operations from each other and make it easier to add new types of nodes or modify existing ones without affecting the traversal algorithm.

## GraphTraverse.java

The package `de.semvox.research.predev.cca.fft.dialoggraph.visitors.internal.dispatcher` contains an interface `GraphTraverse`, which defines the functionality for traversing a graph and generating a list of codes. This interface is typically implemented by classes that need to analyze and process graph-based structures to produce a series of outputs, typically in the form of code segments, based on the nodes and edges of the graph.

The `GraphTraverse` interface has one abstract method:
1. `traverseAndGenerate()` - this method is called to traverse the graph structure and generate a list of `Code` objects. Each `Code` object represents a piece of code generated as a result of the traversal process, tailored to the specifics of the node types and relationships encountered in the graph.

In addition to the interface, there's also a nested class `Metadata`, which encapsulates metadata information related to the graph traversal. this metadata includes:
- The start node identifier (`startNodeId`).
- A `DocumentLocator` object that allows access to the document retrieval based on the start node identifier.

The primary responsibility of implementing classes is to provide concrete implementations for the abstract methods defined in the `GraphTraverse` interface, as well as handle the logic required to generate `Code` objects from the graph.

To explain why and when to use this class:
- **Purpose**: The `Metadata` class is designed for internal use within the context of graph traversal operations within the `de.semvox.research.predev.cca.fft.dialoggraph.visitors.internal.dispatcher` package. It provides a structured and encapsulated way to manage and access relevant data related to the graph traversal, such as starting from a specific node and obtaining its associated document path.
- **Why Use**: this class is useful for managing and retrieving critical information during graph traversal operations, where documents or related paths need to be accessed based on graph nodes.

The `getDocumentPath()` method is particularly relevant because it enables access to the document associated with the start node identifier, allowing further processing or analysis of graph data. this method should only be called after confirming that a document exists for the specified start node identifier.

## Visitors.java

The Java code snippet provided is a part of the class `Visitors` located in the package `de.semvox.research.predev.cca.fft.dialoggraph.visitors.internal.dispatcher`. This class implements various visitors for different types of nodes in a dialog graph, which are used for processing or analyzing the graph data. The main purpose is to decouple algorithms from objects on which they operate and promote flexibility and reusability through the Visitors pattern.

The `Visitors` class contains four fields:
1. `startNodeVisitor` (of type `GraphVisitors.StartNodeVisitor<CodeBlock>`) - responsible for processing start nodes in the dialog graph.
2. `questionNodeVisitor` (of type `GraphVisitors.QuestionNodeVisitor<CodeBlock>`) - handles question nodes in the graph, usually prompts to gather user input.
3. `solutionNodeVisitor` (of type `GraphVisitors.SolutionNodeVisitor<CodeBlock>`) - provides answers or outcomes based on previous inputs from the user.
4. `subdiagnosisNodeVisitor` (of type `GraphVisitors.SubdiagnosisNodeVisitor<CodeBlock>`) - breaks down complex problems into smaller, more manageable parts and solves them individually.
5. `automatedQuestionNodeVisitor` (of type `GraphVisitors.AutomaticQuestionVisitor<CodeBlock>`) - some cases may require the system to ask questions without human intervention.

The class has two constructors:
1. Accepts all six visitors as parameters and initializes the corresponding fields.
2. Is a convenience version which takes only five parameters, using `GraphVisitors.dummyAutomatedQuestionVisitor()` as the automated question visitor.

In summary, this class is designed to support processing or analyzing dialog graph nodes through various visitors, promoting a more flexible and maintainable design approach in software development.

## DfsVisitorDispatcher.java

In the given code file generation/src/main/java/de/semvox/research/predev/cca/fft/dialoggraph/visitors/internal/dispatcher/DfsVisitorDispatcher.java, a class named DfsVisitorDispatcher is defined. This class is responsible for performing depth-first search (DFS) traversal of a dialog graph and generating metadata based on the nodes it visits.

The class has several methods:
1. `traverseAndGenerate()`: this method uses Stream API to flatMap subdiagnosisDispatchers stream, which is assumed to be a collection of dispatcher objects, by calling their traverseAndGenerate() method and collects the results into a new list. It returns this list.
2. `visit(DialogNode dialogNode)`: This private method checks if the current node has already been visited, adds it to the set of visited nodes if not, sets the current node in the context, and then calls visitNodeBasedOnType() with the dialogNode and its relations.
3. `visitNodeBasedOnType(DialogNode dialogNode, DialogNodeRelations dialogNodeRelations)`: this private method uses a switch statement to determine which visitor to use based on the type of the current node. If it is a START node, startVisitor's visitStartNode() method is called with the dialogNode and context as parameters. It then calls the visit() method for all outgoing nodes from the current node. If the current node is an AUTO_QUESTION node, automatedVisitor's visitAutomaticQuestionNode() method is called with the dialogNode and context as parameters.

In summary, DfsVisitorDispatcher class is a visitor implementation that uses a switch statement to dispatch dialog nodes based on their type to different visitors for processing. It also provides a helper method `visitRelationships` to perform DFS traversal over outgoing edges of a node.

## spec

The folder generation/src/main/java/de/semvox/research/predev/cca/fft/dialoggraph/visitors/spec contains four Java files: SpecQuestionVisitor.java, SpecStartVisitor.java, SubSpecStartVisitor.java, and SpecNodeUtils.java. These classes are part of a visitor pattern implementation for processing dialog nodes in the FFT graph.

The purpose of this package is to provide an interface for visiting each type of dialog node in the graph and perform specific actions based on the type of node being visited. This allows us to traverse through the graph and perform operations such as parsing data, generating outputs, or modifying the structure of the graph.

SpecQuestionVisitor.java is responsible for visiting nodes that represent questions in the dialog graph. It has methods for processing questions, handling user input, and generating responses. SubSpecStartVisitor.java visits nodes that start a new sub-specification within a question node, while SpecStartVisitor.java visits the root node of a specification.

SpecNodeUtils.java provides utility methods for working with dialog nodes in the graph. It includes methods for extracting data from nodes, manipulating the graph structure, and creating new nodes.

In order to use this software, you would need to create an instance of one or more of these visitors, and call their visit() method on the root node of your FFT graph. The visitor will then traverse through each node in the graph, calling its visit() method for each node type that it encounters. You can implement custom logic in the visit() method of each visitor to perform specific actions based on the type of dialog node being visited.

Here's an example of how to use SpecQuestionVisitor to parse data from a question node:

```java
SpecQuestionVisitor visitor = new SpecQuestionVisitor();
FFTNode rootNode = // obtain root node of FFT graph
rootNode.accept(visitor);

String userInput = visitor.getUserInput();
List<String> responses = visitor.getResponses();
```

In this example, we create an instance of SpecQuestionVisitor and call its visit() method on the root node of our FFT graph. The visitor then traverses through each node in the graph, calling its visit() method for question nodes. When it encounters a question node, it calls getUserInput() to retrieve the user's input and getResponses() to retrieve possible responses to the question.

By using this software, you can easily parse data from FFT dialogs and perform specific actions based on the type of dialog node being visited. This allows you to generate outputs or modify the structure of the graph in a highly flexible and customizable manner.

## SpecQuestionVisitor.java

```java
import java.util.List;

public class SpecQuestionVisitor extends SpecNodeVisitor<CodeBlock> {

    private MatchPresentationRequest getMatchPresentationRequest(String id, DialogNode node, String nlg) {
        // Implementation for creating a match presentation request based on the given parameters
        // ...
    }

    private void tryToAddMatchShowPictograms(DialogNode node, MatchPresentationRequest presentationRequest) {
        // Implementation for adding match show pictograms to the presentation request if images are present
        // ...
    }

    @Override
    public void visitAutomaticQuestionNode(VisitableContext<CodeBlock> context, DialogNode node) {
        super.visitAutomaticQuestionNode(context, node); // Call superclass implementation
    }

    private void elaborateOneOf(VisitableContext<CodeBlock> context, List<Link> outgoing) {
        if (!outgoing.isEmpty()) {
            OneOf oneOf = new OneOf(); // Create a 'OneOf' instance to store the conversations for the given outgoing links
            for (Link link : outgoing) {
                DialogNode targetNode = link.getTargetNode();
                String nlg = SpecNodeUtils.getNLG(targetNode).orElse("");
                CodeBlock conversation = new CodeBlock(this.currentConversation); // Create a new conversation for this link
                MatchPresentationRequest presentationRequest = getMatchPresentationRequest(SpecNodeUtils.generateIdForMatchRequest(), targetNode, nlg);
                conversation.addFreeTextRequest(); // Add free text request to the conversation
                presentationRequest.setMatches(SpecNodeUtils.getNLGListFromFirstAttribute(targetNode)); // Retrieve matches from the first NLG attribute of the target node
                if (node instanceof Solution) {
                    conversation.addTtsMatch(); // Add text-to-speech match if the current node is a solution
                } else if (node instanceof Subdiagnosis) {
                    conversation.addDialogCompletion().addIgnoreTtsMatch(); // Add dialog completion and ignore TTS match if the current node is a subdiagnosis
                } else {
                    tryToAddMatchShowPictograms(targetNode, presentationRequest); // Add matches for opening microphone and showing pictograms if images are present
                }
                oneOf.addConversation(conversation); // Add this conversation to the 'OneOf' structure
            }

            SpecNodeUtils.getConversationGiven(context).ifPresent(conversation -> conversation.addOneOf(oneOf)); // Add the 'OneOf' structure to the existing conversation if present
        }
    }

    @Override
    public void visitQuestionNode(VisitableContext<CodeBlock> context, DialogNode node) {
        elaborateOneOf(context, node.getOutgoingLinks()); // Call elaborateOneOf method with outgoing links for the given question node
    }
}

```

## SpecStartVisitor.java

The Java class `SpecStartVisitor` is a part of a software module responsible for processing and generating spec (specification) blocks in a dialog graph context. It extends the abstract visitor class `AbstractVisitorWithDocument`, which provides common functionalities related to document processing. This visitor can be used as a part of a larger graph processing framework, focusing specifically on creating spec blocks from dialog nodes.

This class is designed to assist in automating the process of extracting and converting data from dialog nodes into a structured format suitable for further analysis or output. It leverages the `CodeBlock` and `SpecCodeBlocks` classes to generate spec output, which can be used as input for other graph processing modules.

When working with large scale dialog graphs where extracting meaningful data from nodes is crucial, this class can be used for generating documentation reports or for other forms of data analysis that require a structured format of the information contained within the dialog nodes. The class also explains domain concepts like `DialogNode`, `CodeBlock`, and `SpecCodeBlocks`.

This class, along with its dependencies, provides a robust foundation for automating the transformation of dialog graph information into structured spec blocks, which can be further customized and utilized in various applications.

## SubSpecStartVisitor.java

The provided Java class `SubSpecStartVisitor` implements the `StartNodeVisitor<CodeBlock>` interface to handle start nodes within sub-specifications of a conversation graph. This implementation is part of a larger system for generating code blocks in a specific domain and involves visiting dialog nodes representing the start of sub-specification conversations, initiating new conversations segments, and managing the storage and state of generated code blocks within a context. The class extends `AbstractVisitorWithDocument` and overrides its constructor, providing the document locator and a locale for language-specific processing.

The class uses the `SpecCodeBlocks.createActivationFile` method from the `de.semvox.research.predev.cca.fft.output.codegeneration.spec` package to create activation file code blocks for sub-specifications, generating files based on node attributes and contextual data.

The class also implements the `GraphVisitors.StartNodeVisitor<CodeBlock>` interface and provides an implementation of the `visit(DialogNode node)` method, which is called when a start node within the graph is encountered. This method initiates sub-conversation segments for the corresponding start node by setting up sequences that include activation files based on node context and attributes.

In summary, this class is responsible for visiting start nodes within sub-specifications of a conversation graph and setting up sequences based on activation files. It leverages the `SpecCodeBlocks.createActivationFile` method to generate these activation file code blocks, making it useful for generating code for dialog specifications. The class is part of a larger system for generating code blocks in a specific domain, facilitating the specification and execution of processes or behaviors within the system.

## SpecNodeUtils.java

The provided code file `SpecNodeUtils` in package `de.semvox.research.predev.cca.fft.dialoggraph.visitors.spec` is a utility class responsible for providing static methods to assist with operations on nodes and links within a specification-oriented graph structure. It follows the singleton design pattern by having a private constructor and a static method to retrieve an instance of itself. The main purpose of this utility class is to facilitate the extraction and manipulation of identifiers (IDs) from links and navigation within structured scenarios and conversations.

The `idFromTarget(Link link)` method takes a `Link` object as input and returns its target's ID using the edge information, making it useful for generating unique identifiers based on the link's target and edge type. The utility class also provides a generic solution for extracting identifiers from links by promoting code reusability and maintaining consistency across the application.

The `getCurrentSequenceGiven(VisitableContext<CodeBlock> context)` method is useful for identifying the current sequence when traversing through dialog graphs or specifications, as it retrieves the ID of each link's target using `Link.idOf()`, then finds the corresponding sequence element in the root scenario with the help of `findSequenceElementId()` method.

The `getConversationGiven` method, also within the same utility class, is specifically designed to retrieve the current conversation element associated with a node's incoming links within the given context. It aids in identifying conversations by looking up the corresponding conversation block within the scenario from the root using `context.getRootCodeBlockAs(SpecCodeBlocks.Scenario.class)`.

Overall, this utility class offers a comprehensive solution for working with dialog graphs and spec nodes based on given specifications. The provided methods promote code reusability, maintain consistency across the application, and facilitate navigation within structured scenarios and conversations.

## prompt

The `prompt` folder in the `generation/src/main/java/de/semvox/research/predev/cca/fft/dialoggraph/visitors/prompt` package contains a single Java class, `PromptNlgVisitor.java`, which is responsible for converting FFT dialogs into geniOS conversational dialogs using Natural Language Generation (NLG).

The purpose of this class is to traverse the FFT dialog graph and generate NLG prompts that can be used in a conversational application. It uses the `NlgDocument` and `NlgElement` classes from the `com.ibm.argos4j.model` package to represent the NLG document structure, which is then serialized into a geniOS conversation using the `GeniosConverter` class from the `de.semvox.research.predev.cca.fft.dialoggraph.genios.converter` package.

The `PromptNlgVisitor` class provides several methods for converting different types of FFT elements into NLG prompts. These include converting statements, choices, and loops into appropriate NLG elements. The visitor pattern is used to define a common interface for all the different element types in the FFT dialog graph, making it easy to traverse the graph and generate NLG prompts.

To use the `PromptNlgVisitor` class, you would create an instance of it and pass it the root node of the FFT dialog graph. The visitor would then recursively traverse the graph and generate NLG prompts for each element. Finally, you would serialize the resulting NLG document into a geniOS conversation using the `GeniosConverter` class.

Here's an example of how to use the `PromptNlgVisitor` class:
```java
import com.ibm.argos4j.model.NlgDocument;
import de.semvox.research.predev.cca.fft.dialoggraph.FFTNode;
import de.semvox.research.predev.cca.fft.dialoggraph.genios.converter.GeniosConverter;
import de.semvox.research.predev.cca.fft.dialoggraph.visitors.prompt.PromptNlgVisitor;

// Assume fftGraph is the root node of the FFT dialog graph
FFTNode fftGraph = ...;

// Create an instance of PromptNlgVisitor
PromptNlgVisitor visitor = new PromptNlgVisitor();

// Generate NLG prompts for the FFT dialog graph
NlgDocument nlgDoc = visitor.visit(fftGraph);

// Serialize the NLG document into a geniOS conversation using GeniosConverter
GeniosConverter converter = new GeniosConverter();
String geniosConversation = converter.convertToConversation(nlgDoc);
```

## PromptNlgVisitor.java

The `PromptNlgVisitor` class in the provided Java code file is a visitor for DialogNode objects within a dialog graph, specifically designed to generate Natural Language Generation (NLG) prompts for question nodes. It implements two interfaces - `QuestionNodeVisitor<CodeBlock>` and `SolutionNodeVisitor<CodeBlock>`, indicating its responsibility for visiting both question and solution nodes in the dialog graph.

The class has a constructor accepting a `DocumentLocator` object, which is used to fetch text data for generating NLG prompts based on the content of the visited nodes. The main business logic within these methods involves retrieving the text for the dialog node from the `DocumentLocator`, formatting it, and returning an instance of `CodeBlock` containing the NLG prompt.

The class also provides the implementation for the `visitQuestionNode(DialogNode node)` method which generates NLG prompts for question nodes by calling the helper function `buildPrompt`. The same process is followed for the `visitSolutionNode(DialogNode node)` method, but for solution nodes.

This class is crucial in facilitating NLG prompt generation by providing a standardized method to process both question and solution nodes within a dialog graph. It abstracts away the complexity of text retrieval, formatting, and code generation, making it easier to integrate into larger software systems for natural language processing tasks.

## conversation

The `generation/src/main/java/de/semvox/research/predev/cca/fft/dialoggraph/visitors/conversation` package contains various classes that serve as visitors for traversing and extracting information from FFT dialog graphs. These classes are designed to convert FFT dialogs into geniOs conversational dialogs. The package is organized in a hierarchical manner, with each class responsible for visiting specific nodes or parts of the graph.

1. `ConversationAutomaticQuestionVisitor`: This visitor is responsible for converting automatic questions found in the FFT dialog graph into their equivalent conversational dialog node representation. Automatic questions are often used to guide conversation flow without explicit user input.

2. `ConversationSubdiagnosisVisitor`: this visitor converts subdiagnosis nodes from the FFT graph into their corresponding conversational dialog node. A subdiagnosis represents a sub-problem or an alternative path that can be taken in a conversation.

3. `ConversationQuestionNodeVisitor`: this visitor takes care of converting question nodes in the FFT graph to their respective conversational dialog nodes. Questions are fundamental elements in a dialog and often require explicit user input.

4. `ConversationSolutionVisitor`: this visitor converts solution nodes found in the FFT graph into their equivalent conversational dialog node representation. Solutions provide pre-defined answers to certain questions.

5. `ConversationSubDialogStartNodeVisitor`: this visitor is responsible for converting sub-dialog start nodes from the FFT graph into their corresponding conversational dialog node. A sub-dialog is a separate conversation that can be initiated within another one.

6. `ConversationStartNodeVisitor`: this class is at the core of the visitors and serves as the main entry point for visiting the FFT graph. It initiates the conversion process by traversing through each node in the graph, applying the appropriate visitor based on the type of node it encounters.

The `ConversationalDialogGenerator` class uses these visitors to convert the FFT dialog graph into a conversational dialog structure that can be further processed or used for geniOs conversational dialogs. The visitors ensure that all relevant information from the FFT graph is accurately represented in the conversational dialog nodes, allowing for proper translation and interpretation of the dialog flow.

Using this library effectively means integrating it with your existing project, defining a suitable interface or API to interact with the `ConversationGenerators` classes, and then using those classes to generate conversational dialogs from FFT dialog graphs. This integration should allow you to perform various operations on the converted dialog data, such as querying nodes based on certain criteria, analyzing patterns in dialog flow, or generating reports and summaries of the dialog content.

## ConversationAutomaticQuestionVisitor.java

This Java code defines classes related to a conversation flow and natural language processing application called CCa (Conversational Command Assistant). It includes a main functionality class `MainFunctionality`, as well as subclasses for handling automatic questions (`AutoQuestion`), understanding blocks (`UnderstandBlock`, `UnderstandingBlockBuilder`, etc.), and code blocks (`CodeBlock`, `ReactionContainer`, `QAEdge`, etc.). The main functionality of the code is to dynamically generate and add understanding blocks to conversations based on the structure of the given code tree, using a visitor pattern for modular and extensible code.

The key components include:
- `MainFunctionality`: Contains methods for elaborate options, elaborate reacts, and creating fallback blocks. It uses the visitor pattern to handle different types of code blocks in a conversation flow.
- `CodeBlockVisitor` and its subclasses (`AutoQuestion`, `UnderstandingBlock`, etc.): Defines methods for visiting various code block types.
- `ConversationAutomaticQuestionVisitor`: Implements the visitor pattern to visit code blocks in a conversation graph, adding them to their parent conversation if they exist.
- `DialogNode` and its subclasses (`Reaction`, etc.): Represents nodes in a conversation flow with links and utterance information.

This class structure allows for easy extension by adding new types of code block visitors or understanding block builders as needed.

## ConversationSubdiagnosisVisitor.java

The `ConversationSubdiagnosisVisitor` class is a part of a Java project designed for generating conversation code from dialog graphs. It fulfills the role of visiting subdiagnosis nodes in the graph and generating side effects based on these nodes, utilizing methods provided by the framework. The visitor uses classes from the CCA (Common Components Architecture) toolkit to handle document locators, manage code blocks, generate conversational code, and perform other necessary operations related to dialog processing.

In this implementation, the `visit` method is called when visiting each subdiagnosis node within the graph. It checks for certain conditions and generates side effects based on the information found in the subdiagnosis node. The visitor keeps track of previously understood subdiagnosis nodes using a set called `registeredUnderstand`.

The `generateSideEffect` method is where the main functionality lies, which includes generating understanding check reactions based on incoming links within the subdiagnosis node. If an understand name has not been previously registered, it triggers specific actions or operations through side effects by updating the interaction turn and adding an understanding reaction to the conversation structure. The generated `CodeBlock` is then added to the root code block if it is a `ConversationalCodeBlocks.Conversation`.

The class follows the visitor design pattern, where it defines how to process subdiagnosis nodes in a dialog graph. By implementing the `DialogNodeVisitor` interface and using the `visitSubdiagnosisNode` method, this class can efficiently traverse the conversation graph and handle specific actions or side effects based on the conditions present within the subdiagnosis nodes.

## ConversationQuestionNodeVisitor.java

The provided Java code defines a class `ConversationQuestionNodeVisitor` that implements the `GraphVisitors.QuestionNodeVisitor<CodeBlock>` interface for processing question nodes within a conversation graph. This visitor is particularly useful in creating conversational interfaces where responses depend on dialog context and specific questions posed in the dialog nodes.

The class utilizes document locators to display localized content based on the language settings, generates output code blocks for speech output to be displayed in a conversational interface, and implements checks for user understanding of the dialog flow.

Visiting Dialog Nodes: The visitor is designed to process question nodes within the context of a conversation graph by implementing the `GraphVisitors.QuestionNodeVisitor<CodeBlock>` interface. It ensures that this visitor can handle any question node in the graph and generate output code blocks based on the dialog node being visited.

Handling Question Node Logic: The class handles logic for processing questions, generating output code blocks, and implements understanding checks.

Localization Support: Utilizes document locators to fetch and display localized content based on the language settings.

Responsibilities:
1. Visiting Dialog Nodes: Implements the `GraphVisitors.QuestionNodeVisitor<CodeBlock>` interface, ensuring that this visitor can process question nodes within a conversation graph.
2. Handling Question Node Logic: Handles logic for processing questions and generating output code blocks based on the dialog node being visited.
3. Localization Support: Utilizes document locators to fetch and display localized content based on the language settings.

Why and When to Use: This visitor is particularly useful when developing conversational interfaces where users are expected to provide input based on a predefined set of questions in a dialogue graph. It facilitates the generation of output code blocks tailored to these questions, ensuring that the responses adhere to specific rules or guidelines.

Code Examples:
```java
// Example usage:
ConversationQuestionNodeVisitor visitor = new ConversationQuestionNodeVisitor(documentLocator, languageSetting);
DialogNode questionNode = // obtain a dialog node from the conversation graph
Optional<CodeBlock> output = visitor.visitQuestionNode(questionNode);

if (output.isPresent()) {
    // Process the generated code block for speech output
} else {
    // Handle the case when no output was generated for the question node
}
```

## ConversationSolutionVisitor.java

This Java class, `ConversationSolutionVisitor`, serves as a visitor for handling solution nodes within a dialog graph. It specifically focuses on delivering solutions in a conversational interface where responses depend on the dialog context and the specific solutions posed in the dialog nodes. The class utilizes document locators and language settings to fetch and display localized content.

The class extends from `AbstractVisitorWithDocument`, which ensures access to necessary resources like document locators and handles locale settings. It implements the interface `GraphVisitors.SolutionNodeVisitor<CodeBlock>` to define how it should visit solution nodes in a graph, returning code blocks as results.

This class maintains a set of registered solutions to avoid redundant generation of code blocks for solutions that have already been processed. The constructor initializes a new instance with the specified `DocumentLocator` and `Locale`. 

The method `getRegisteredSolutions()` allows you to see which solutions have been processed by the visitor, while the overridden `visit()` method ensures that each solution is visited only once. If a solution has already been registered, it throws an `IllegalStateException` to prevent redundant processing.

In summary, `ConversationSolutionVisitor` is responsible for visiting solution nodes in a dialog graph and generating code blocks based on the solutions provided. It utilizes document locators and language settings to display localized content and maintains a set of registered solutions to ensure each solution is processed once.

## ConversationSubDialogStartNodeVisitor.java

```java
public class ConversationSubDialogStartNodeVisitor extends AbstractVisitorWithDocument implements GraphVisitors.StartNodeVisitor<CodeBlock> {
    // Constructor that initializes the document locator and language settings
    public ConversationSubDialogStartNodeVisitor(DocumentLocator documentLocator, Locale language) {
        super(documentLocator, language);
    }

    // Implementation of the StartNodeVisitor interface method for visiting start nodes
    @Override
    public CodeBlock visitStartNode(VisitableContext<CodeBlock> context) {
        // Fetch necessary information and generate an initiate event for sub-dialogs
        String reactionReferenceName = StringUtils.reactionName(node.getName());
        initiateWithSubscriptionFor(node.getName(), Constants.TRIGGER_URI, node.getName());

        CodeBlock.ReactionContainer initiateEvent = new CodeBlock.ReactionContainer(reactionReferenceName);

        // Check if there's a conversation code block and add the initiate event to it
        if (context.getRootCodeBlockAs(ConversationalCodeBlocks.Conversation.class) != null) {
            context.getRootCodeBlockAs(ConversationalCodeBlocks.Conversation.class).addReaction(initiateEvent);
            context.setCurrentBlock(initiateEvent);
        }

        // TODO: It would be nice to remove this logic as it doesn't seem relevant to the current implementation
        return initiateEvent; // Return the generated initiate event for further processing if needed
    }
}
```

## ConversationStartNodeVisitor.java

The `ConversationStartNodeVisitor` is an essential component of the DialogGraph framework, responsible for handling the start node within a conversation graph. It provides functionalities to initialize the conversation flow by setting up global understand blocks and initiating event subscriptions based on document locators and language settings. This class plays a critical role in building conversations using dialog graphs by ensuring that the conversation begins with the right context and functionality.

## reaction

The folder generation/src/main/java/de/semvox/research/predev/cca/fft/dialoggraph/visitors/conversation/reaction contains several classes that are used to convert FFT dialogs into conversational dialogs. Here's a general overview of what each class does and how they relate to each other:

1. ConversationalState.java: This class represents the state of a conversation, including the current node in the graph and any relevant information about it. It has methods for updating the state based on user input or events.
2. Reactions.java: this class contains a list of possible reactions to different types of events that may occur in a conversation. Each reaction has a name and a description, as well as a method for executing the reaction.
3. AbstractReactionBuilder.java: This is an abstract base class for building reactions based on the type of event that occurred. Subclasses will implement specific logic to generate different types of reactions based on the input from the FFT dialogs.

The purpose of these classes is to define how conversational dialogs are generated from FFT dialogs. By defining the states and possible reactions, developers can create a more natural and intuitive user experience for users interacting with their conversations.

To use this library, you would need to instantiate an instance of ConversationalState and then call its methods to update the state based on user input or events. You would also need to provide an implementation of AbstractReactionBuilder that generates specific types of reactions based on the FFT dialogs.

Here's a simple example of how to use these classes:
```java
ConversationalState state = new ConversationalState();
state.update("User", "Hello, how can I assist you today?");
Reactions reactions = new Reactions();
AbstractReactionBuilder builder = new MyReactionBuilder(reactions);
builder.buildReactionsForEvent(state.getCurrentNode());
```
In this example, we first create a new instance of ConversationalState and update it with a user's input. We then create an instance of Reactions and pass it to the AbstractReactionBuilder. The builder generates specific reactions based on the current node in the graph. Finally, we call the buildReactionsForEvent method on the builder to generate all possible reactions for the current node.

## ConversationalState.java

```java
package de.semvox.research.predev.cca.fft.dialoggraph.visitors.conversation.reaction;

public enum ConversationalState {
    ELABORATE_UNDERSTAND,
    ELABORATE_REACT_FROM_AUTO_QUESTION,
    ELABORATE_REACT_FOR_FALLBACK_IN_AUTO_QUESTION,
    GLOBAL_UNDERSTAND;

    // Each state has a specific purpose:
    // 1. ELABORATE_UNDERSTAND - Indicates that the bot is currently trying to understand what the user wants or needs to do.
    // It's typically used when the bot has received input but still lacks enough information to make an informed decision.

    // 2. ELABORATE_REACT_FROM_AUTO_QUESTION - Represents a more advanced level of understanding where the bot is reacting automatically to predefined questions or prompts.
    // It's used when the bot has identified what the user wants or needs, but it still needs further clarification or information before taking an action.

    // 3. ELABORATE_REACT_FOR_FALLBACK_IN_AUTO_QUESTION - Similar to ELABORATE_REACT_FROM_AUTO_QUESTION, but it's specifically used when the bot encounters a fallback question or prompt that doesn't match any predefined responses.
    // Allows for the bot to offer alternative or more generic responses in such situations.

    // 4. GLOBAL_UNDERSTAND - Used when the bot has fully understood the user's request or query and can proceed with a specific action.
    // It's typically reached after all necessary information has been gathered.
}
```

## Reactions.java

The provided Java code defines an interface for creating different types of reactions in a conversational system, and includes methods for creating specific types of reactions based on the current conversation state. The main class `Reactions` includes two static methods `createFor` and `buildString`.

Method `createFor` takes three parameters: `ConversationalState state`, `DocumentLocator documentLocator`, and `Locale language`. It returns an instance of one of the subclasses of `AbstractReactionBuilder` based on the provided `state`. The `ConversationalState` enum defines different states a conversation can be in.

The `buildString` method does not take any parameters and returns an empty string. It is likely that this method was intended to be overridden in one of the subclasses of `AbstractReactionBuilder`, but as it is currently implemented, it always returns an empty string.

The main class also includes a private static nested class `InitialReactionBuilder` which extends `AbstractReactionBuilder`. This class has a constructor that takes a `DocumentLocator` and a `Locale` as parameters, and overrides the `buildReaction` method to construct a reaction with specific characteristics.

The main class also includes an inner class `NO_REACTION`, which is used as a default reaction when there is no specific reaction defined for a given dialog node. It has an empty `buildReaction` method and logs an info message when its `build()` or `buildString()` methods are called.

The code provided appears to be a part of a larger software system that deals with dialog graph generation and manipulation. The class `Reactions` is a visitor pattern implementation for generating reactions in a dialog graph, while the nested classes `InitialReactionBuilder` and `NO_REACTION` provide specific implementations for creating different types of reactions based on the current node being processed.

The `@Override` annotation indicates that this method overrides a method from its parent class. The `buildReaction` method takes several parameters, including reference name, dialog node, then understand names, link, and context, and returns a complex object representing the generated reaction. The method checks if the current node being processed is the parent start node, and based on this check, constructs a reaction using the superclass's builder method with appropriate modifications and adds interaction updates to the builder before building the reaction.

Combining the documentation from all provided code snippets provides a comprehensive overview of how the given Java classes work together to generate reactions in a dialog graph using the visitor pattern and the builder design pattern.

## AbstractReactionBuilder.java

This Java code snippet defines a package `de.semvox.research.predev.cca.fft.dialoggraph.visitors.conversation.reaction` with the class `AbstractReactionBuilder`. The `AbstractReactionBuilder` is responsible for constructing dialog reactions and is part of a larger system for building dialog graphs in a conversational application.

The class has several methods for managing dialog reactions:
1. `addAllReactions(List<CodeBlock.ReactChild> reactions)`: Adds all provided reactions to the builder, returning the current instance for method chaining.
2. `withReactNameForReferenceOnly(String referenceName)`: Sets the react name and reference name to empty strings, using the provided reference name for referencing purposes only, returning the current instance for method chaining.
3. `buildInteractionUpdate(Link link, VisitableContext<CodeBlock> context)`: Constructs interaction updates based on the given link and context, handling different cases such as skipped links and updating interaction turns depending on dialog node types and edge properties.
4. `buildUpdatesForSkippedNodes(Link link)`: Helper method to build updates for skipped nodes by creating reactions for the skipped node and the end interaction with a skipped edge.
5. `addInteractionUpdates(DialogNodeRelations currentNode)`: Adds interaction updates directly to the builder, updating the turn based on the provided current node, returning the current instance for chaining.

Overall, this class provides an abstract foundation for building dialog reactions in a conversational application, allowing developers to easily manage and manipulate reactions within a dialog graph.

## builders

The `generation/src/main/java/de/semvox/research/predev/cca/fft/builders` package contains several classes that are responsible for building and traversing FFT (Fault-Finding Tree) graphs into geniOS conversational dialogs. These classes provide functionality to process the graph structure, extract information from the nodes, and create the final geniOS dialog representation.

SubDiagnosisTraverserFactoryImpl: This class is responsible for creating traversers that can traverse the SubDiagnosis nodes of the FFT graph. The SubDiagnosis node contains information about a specific problem or issue, while the traverser is used to navigate through these nodes and extract relevant data.

SubDiagnosisTraverseFactory: this interface defines methods for creating traversers that can traverse SubDiagnosis nodes in the FFT graph. It's implemented by SubDiagnosisTraverserFactoryImpl class.

GraphTraverseFactory: This interface defines methods for creating traversers that can navigate through the FFT graph. Its implementation includes classes like SubDiagnosisTraverserFactoryImpl and GraphTraverseFactoryImpl.

PathFactoryHelper: this utility class provides helper methods for creating paths in the FFT graph. It's used by other classes in the package to traverse the graph and extract information from specific nodes.

QuestionFinder: This class contains a method for finding all questions in the FFT graph that need to be answered during the conversation. The method returns a list of paths, where each path represents a question that needs to be asked.

TraverseFactories: this interface defines methods for creating traversers that can traverse different types of nodes in the FFT graph. It's implemented by GraphTraverseFactoryImpl and SubDiagnosisTraverserFactoryImpl classes.

GenerationModule: This class is a module responsible for orchestrating the generation process. Its main function is to create an instance of the TraverseFactories interface, which is used by other classes in the package to traverse the FFT graph and extract information from it. The GenerationModule class provides methods like getTraverseFactory() that can be used to obtain the traverse factory.

Overall, this package contains a set of classes and interfaces that are designed to process FFT graphs and generate geniOS dialogs. The TraverseFactories interface is used to create traversers for different types of nodes in the graph, while the SubDiagnosisTraverserFactoryImpl class specifically creates traversers for SubDiagnosis nodes. The GenerationModule class provides a convenient way to obtain a traverse factory and start the generation process.

Practical examples:

Suppose you have an FFT graph that represents a fault-finding dialog about a specific product or service. You can use the GenerationModule class to create a traverser factory, which in turn can be used to traverse the graph and extract information from the nodes. Here's an example of how you might use these classes:

```java
// Create a generation module instance
GenerationModule module = new GenerationModule();

// Get the traverse factory from the module
TraverseFactories factory = module.getTraverseFactory();

// Use the factory to create a traverser for SubDiagnosis nodes
SubDiagnosisTraverser traverser = factory.createSubDiagnosisTraverser();

// Traverse the graph and extract information from SubDiagnosis nodes
List<Path> paths = traverser.traverse(fftGraph);

// Use the extracted information to create a geniOS dialog
Dialog dialog = DialogConverter.convertToDialog(paths);
```
In this example, we first create an instance of the GenerationModule class and get the traverse factory from it. We then use the factory to create a traverser for SubDiagnosis nodes, which is used to navigate through the graph and extract relevant data. Finally, we convert the extracted information into a geniOS dialog using a DialogConverter utility class.

When should you use this package?

This package is useful when you need to process FFT graphs in your software project and generate conversational dialogs based on that information. It can be used for creating customized fault-finding dialogs for specific products or services, as well as for generating generic fault-finding dialogs for different types of problems.

Note: The package and its classes are part of a larger library that is designed to process FFT graphs and generate geniOS dialogs. If you're not familiar with the project, it may be helpful to consult with your software engineering team or seek guidance from an experienced developer.

```

## SubDiagnosisTraverseFactory.java

The `SubDiagnosisTraverseFactory` Java interface is part of a software project designed for creating traversers for Subdiagnosis data structures in the context of code generation tasks. It contains two methods: `createTraversers(List<Subdiagnosis> subdiagnoses, Code.CodeType codeType, VisitorContext context)` and `newMetadata(String docId)`.

The first method takes a list of Subdiagnosis objects, a code type, and a VisitorContext as parameters, returning a list of GraphTraverse objects. This is responsible for creating instances of GraphTraverse that can be used to traverse the Subdiagnosis data structure.

The second method `newMetadata(String docId)` also takes a document ID as a parameter and returns a Metadata object which represents metadata associated with the graph traversal.

These methods serve as an abstract layer for creating GraphTraverse objects, enabling developers to encapsulate logic related to graph traversal while abstracting away specific details of implementation.

## GraphTraverseFactory.java

The provided code is part of a Java package that defines an interface for creating instances of `GraphTraverse`. This interface serves as an abstraction layer over the instantiation of `GraphTraverse` objects, which are dependent on the graph structure, localization settings, and configuration parameters. The interface contains a single method:

```java
DocumentLocator createGraphTraverse(Locale locale, DialogNode dialogRoot, Graph<DialogNode, QAEdge> graph);
```

This method creates an instance of `GraphTraverse` based on the following parameters:
- `locale`: The localization settings for the `GraphTraverse`.
- `dialogRoot`: The root node of the dialog graph.
- `graph`: The graph structure on which the `GraphTraverse` will operate.

The purpose and responsibilities of this interface are as follows:
- It abstracts the instantiation process of `GraphTraverse`, providing a clear, simple interface for creating instances based on specific requirements.
- It allows different implementations of `GraphTraverse` to be swapped in without affecting other parts of the codebase.
- It encapsulates the dependencies related to graph structures, localization settings, and configuration parameters in one place.

To use this interface effectively:
1. Create an instance of the concrete implementation class that implements this interface.
2. Call the `createGraphTraverse` method with appropriate parameters to obtain a `GraphTraverse` object.
3. Use the returned `GraphTraverse` object to traverse and manipulate the graph as needed.

It's important to note that while this design pattern can be beneficial in large-scale applications, it might not be necessary or efficient for smaller projects. It is particularly useful when there are multiple components within a system that need to interact with different types of graphs or have varying configurations.

In the given code snippet, the `GraphTraverseFactory` class serves as a factory class that creates instances of the `GraphTraverse` class. The `GraphTraverse` class itself is responsible for traversing through a graph and performing specific operations based on certain criteria. The create method of the `GraphTraverseFactory` class takes several parameters including a graph, document locator, locale, name, and factory builder. These parameters are used to configure the new instance of GraphTraverse that is being created. The method returns a new instance of `GraphTraverse` configured according to the provided parameters.

## PathFactoryHelper.java

The provided Java code defines two classes within the package `de.semvox.research.predev.cca.fft.builders` - `PathFactoryHelper` and `ProjectPaths`. The `PathFactoryHelper` is responsible for resolving paths based on file structure, while the `ProjectPaths` class encapsulates important file paths along with a document locator for further processing in a NLP or CL toolkit related to document graph generation.

**PathFactoryHelper Class:**
- It provides methods to resolve paths based on file structure and create instances of `ProjectPaths`.
- The class is final and cannot be extended, making it suitable for use as an immutable object.
- It holds the main path to be processed and uses a `DocumentLocatorFactory` to create document locators for resolving documents within that path.
- It accepts a `ContentParser` for interpreting content from files and has a locale parameter to adapt file path resolution.

**ProjectPaths Class:**
- This class encapsulates paths to important files used in the NLP pipeline for document graph construction.
- It holds three properties: `docListPath`, `graphPath`, and `documentLocator`.
- The `documentLocator` is an instance of a `DocumentLocator` class which helps in locating and retrieving documents based on their IDs or paths.

**Constructor for PathFactoryHelper:**
```java
public final class PathFactoryHelper {
    private final Path path;
    private final DocumentLocatorFactory documentLocatorFactory;
    private final ContentParser contentParser;
    private final Locale locale;

    // Constructor and methods are not shown due to length constraints.
}
```

**Constructor for ProjectPaths:**
```java
public class ProjectPaths {
    private final Path docListPath;
    private final Path graphPath;
    private final DocumentLocator documentLocator;

    // Constructor and methods are not shown due to length constraints.
}
```

In summary, the `PathFactoryHelper` class is responsible for resolving file paths based on structure and creating instances of `ProjectPaths`, which encapsulates important paths along with a document locator for further operations in a NLP or CL pipeline. The `ProjectPaths` class serves as a container for these paths and a DocumentLocator object, making it easy to manage the files related to document graph construction within the pipeline.

# QuestionFinder Class

## Overview
The `QuestionFinder` class is a critical component within the pre-development research project at SemVox Research, specifically in the domain of Automatic Question Type Finder (AQTF). It aims to automatically categorize questions from documents by identifying specific types. The class utilizes various interfaces and classes provided by the `de.semvox.research.predev.cca` package for document retrieval and analysis.

## Purpose
The main goal is to identify and categorize questions in documents, with a focus on warning lights and models. This helps streamline question management and support processes within the pre-development phase of various projects.

## Responsibilities
1. **Constructor**: Initializes the `QuestionFinder` instance with a `DocumentLocator` dependency for fetching documents.
2. **findTypeFrom(docId)**: Implements logic to find the type of question from a document identified by its ID using the provided `documentLocator`.
3. **findIn(valueList)**: A helper method that takes a list of string values as input and tries to identify specific types of questions based on these values.

## Important Domain Concepts
- **AutomaticQuestionType**: Represents the possible types of questions that can be identified automatically, e.g., WARNING_LIGHT or MODEL.
- **DocumentLocator**: An interface used to fetch documents by their ID.
- **AbstractFftDocument**: A model class representing a document in the FFT framework.

## Usage and Best Practices
The `QuestionFinder` class should be instantiated with an appropriate `DocumentLocator` instance before use. It then can categorize questions from documents by calling the `findTypeFrom(docId)` method, passing a document's ID as a parameter.

## Example
```java
DocumentLocator locator = new FileSystemDocumentLocator(); // Or any other DocumentLocator implementation
QuestionFinder finder = new QuestionFinder(locator);
Optional<AutomaticQuestionType> questionType = finder.findTypeFrom("12345");

if (questionType.isPresent()) {
    System.out.println("The document is related to: " + questionType.get());
} else {
    System.out.println("Unable to determine the type of question.");
}
```

This example demonstrates how to use the `QuestionFinder` class by fetching a document's question type based on its ID, handling the result accordingly.

## Conclusion
The `QuestionFinder` class is a key part of the pre-development research project at SemVox Research, play a crucial role in automating question management and facilitating effective support processes for various projects. The class provides methods for identifying specific types of questions within documents, which are based on predefined criteria. It utilizes interfaces and classes from the `de.semvox.research.predev.cca` package to fetch and analyze documents.

## TraverseFactories.java

The `TraverseFactories` class provides factory methods for creating specialized graph traversal dispatchers tailored to different types of specifications. The `newSpecTraverser()` method is particularly useful in handling sub-specification traversals, as it returns a `GraphTraverse` object tailored for the specified graph with customized start and question visitors, visitor context, code type, and factory builder.

This class likely encapsulates various strategies for graph traversal, including depth-first search (DFS), breadth-first search (BFS), or any other algorithm suitable for exploring the dialog graph nodes. The `Visitors` class may contain different implementations of the `Visitor` interface used for handling specific types of nodes in the graph during traversal.

Overall, this code snippet is an essential component for managing and executing efficient graph traversals over dialog graphs with specialized logic tailored to sub-specification traversals.

## GenerationModule.java

The `GenerationModule` class is a part of a larger system for performing text generation. It provides various methods for managing and generating content based on graph data. The `Builder` class facilitates its configuration by providing methods to set various properties such as the path to a file, locale, document locator, content parser, and name.

The `GenerationModule` class has a method called `getOriginalName()` which returns the original name of the module. This is useful for identifying or referencing the module by its name.

The `GenerationModule` class also provides a method called `getContentParser()` which returns an instance of `ContentParser`. The `ContentParser` class is responsible for extracting text content from HTML documents, which is used in the generation process to ensure that the extracted text accurately represents the content of the source documents.

The Builder class provides a way to configure and create instances of `GenerationModule` by specifying various properties such as the path to a file, locale, document locator, content parser, and name. Here are some key features of the Builder:

- The `Builder` constructor takes in a graph path and a module name. It initializes the builder with these values.
- The `loadAll()` method is used to load all necessary paths based on the provided graph path. It resolves the document list path, document locator, and other related paths using `PathFactoryHelper`.
- The static method `forSingleGraphFilePath()` provides a convenient way to create an instance of Builder with a single graph file path and module name.

The Builder class allows you to chain together methods for a more fluent API. For example:

```java
GenerationModule module = GenerationModule.Builder.forDocListPath("path/to/doclist")
                                         .withLocale(Locale.ENGLISH)
                                         .withDocumentLocator("path/to/documentlocator")
                                         .withContentParser(new ContentParser())
                                         .withName("MyModule")
                                         .build();
```

In summary, the `GenerationModule` class manages and generates content based on graph data, while the `Builder` class facilitates its configuration by providing various properties to customize the module's behavior.

In conclusion, this utility class provides essential functionality for working with string streams in Java, making it easier to handle conversions between OutputStreams and Strings.

## assertions

The folder test-library/src/main/java/de/semvox/research/predev/cca/assertions is a package that contains two Java classes: GraphAssert and CodeAssert. These classes are part of a testing framework for the project, which is focused on converting FFT dialogs into geniOs conversational dialogs.

GraphAssert: This class provides methods for asserting the correctness of graphml files generated from FFT dialogs. It includes methods for comparing the nodes and edges in the graph, as well as checking for specific properties or behaviors related to the graph structure. The reason to use this class is that it allows developers to easily test the correctness of their graphml generation code by comparing expected results with actual outputs.

CodeAssert: this class provides methods for asserting the correctness of code generated from FFT dialogs. It includes methods for checking syntax errors, semantic issues, and runtime behavior. The reason to use this class is that it allows developers to easily test the correctness of their code generation code by comparing expected results with actual outputs.

The GraphAssert and CodeAssert classes are part of a larger testing framework that includes other assertions related to different aspects of the project's functionality. They provide a practical way for developers to verify the correctness of their code and ensure that it works as expected.

For example, if a developer is working on a feature that involves parsing FFT dialogs into graphml files, they can use the GraphAssert class to compare the expected graph structure with the actual output generated by their code. This way, they can catch errors early in the development process and fix them before they affect the final product.

Similarly, if a developer is working on a feature that involves generating code from FFT dialogs, they can use the CodeAssert class to check for syntax errors, semantic issues, or runtime behavior. This way, they can ensure that their code works as expected and does not have any bugs.

## GraphAssert.java

The `GraphAssert` class in the `test-library/src/main/java/de/semvox/research/predev/cca/assertions/GraphAssert.java` file is a custom assertion library for JUnit testing that provides functionality to assert properties of graphs, such as equality or similarity. This class extends from `AbstractAssert`, which is part of the AssertJ library for Java. It takes a `Graph<DialogNode, QAEdge>` object as an input in its constructor and stores it as the actual graph being tested. The class provides two static methods:
1. `assertThat(Graph<DialogNode, QAEdge> actual)`: this method creates a new instance of `GraphAssert` with the given graph as the actual graph to be tested. It returns an instance of `GraphAssert` which allows for method chaining and additional assertions.
2. `IsSimilarTo(Graph<DialogNode, QAEdge> expectedGraph)`: This method compares the current graph being tested (`actual`) with another expected graph (`expectedGraph`). The comparison is done by exporting both graphs to DOT format (a graph description language) and then comparing the two strings. If the exported strings are not equal, an `AssertionError` is thrown with a custom message indicating that the two graphs are not similar.
The `DotDialogExporter` inner class within the `GraphAssert` class is used to convert a graph into its DOT representation. The DOT format is widely used in graph visualization and allows for easy visualization of complex graph structures. It provides constants for the label attribute, as well as a static logger object for logging any messages related to exporting the graph.

Overall, this `GraphAssert` class plays an important role in testing graph data structures by providing a convenient way to assert their properties and relationships. The provided Java code defines a class `DotDialogExporter` within the package `de.semvox.research.predev.cca.assertions`, which is part of the file named `GraphAssert.java`. This exporter is designed to export a given graph as a DOT formatted string, which is commonly used for graph visualizations in many tools and languages. The class has a private static inner class `DotDialogExporter` that handles the conversion of a graph to DOT format.

## CodeAssert.java

The given file `CodeAssert` is part of a testing library for comparing source codes in Java. The class extends `AbstractAssert` from the AssertJ framework, which provides assertions for testing various data types. It includes import statements for helper classes and utility methods.

This class defines the `CodeAssert` class which extends `AbstractAssert<CodeAssert, String>`. The constructor takes a string parameter and passes it to the superclass constructor. The static method `assertThat(String actual)` creates an instance of `CodeAssert` with the given string value. The `IsSimilarTo()` methods are used to compare two source codes after normalizing them, while the `normalizeLineEndings()` method is a private helper function for this purpose.

The class also provides overloaded versions of the `IsSimilarTo()` method that take an `InputStream` as input instead of a string, making it easier to test code snippets from files or streams.

Overall, this file serves as a custom assertion class for validating Java source codes, providing different types of assertions such as `IsSimilarTo()`, `IsSimilarToContentInResource()`, and `contains()`.

## core



## exceptions

The folder core/src/main/java/de/semvox/research/predev/cca/exceptions is a part of the software project and contains three Java classes: CloneGraphException, DiagnosisLoadingException, and DiagnosisNotFoundException. These exceptions are related to handling errors that may occur during the process of converting FFT dialogs into geniOs conversational dialogs.

CloneGraphException is thrown when an error occurs while cloning a graph. This exception can happen if there is an issue with the graph structure or data, and it is used to indicate that an error has occurred during the cloning process.

DiagnosisLoadingException is thrown when an error occurs while loading a diagnosis from a file. this exception can be thrown if there is an issue with the file format or content, and it is used to indicate that an error has occurred during the loading process.

DiagnosisNotFoundException is thrown when a requested diagnosis cannot be found in the system. This exception can happen if there is no matching diagnosis for a given identifier, and it is used to indicate that the requested diagnosis does not exist in the system.

The package de.semvox.research.predev.cca is designed to handle conversational dialogs and their conversion from FFT dialogs to geniOs format. The classes provided by this package are essential for performing these tasks, and they should be used as part of the software project.

For example, when a user needs to load a diagnosis from a file, the method loadDiagnosis() can throw a DiagnosisLoadingException if there is an issue with the file format or content. Similarly, if a user tries to clone a graph and encounters an error during the process, the CloneGraphException should be thrown.

In summary, the exceptions in this package are designed to handle errors that may occur during the conversion of FFT dialogs into geniOs conversational dialogs. These exceptions are used to provide information about the nature of the error that occurred and can help users diagnose and fix issues with their software.

## CloneGraphException.java

```
The CloneGraphException class within the de.semvox.research.predev.cca.exceptions package is a custom unchecked runtime exception designed specifically for handling errors during graph cloning operations. It extends RuntimeException, allowing it to be thrown without requiring it in method signatures.

This class includes a constructor that accepts a message (String) and an optional cause (Exception), providing additional details about the error and its potential root cause.

The primary purpose of this exception is to notify callers about any issues encountered during graph cloning, enabling them to take appropriate actions or diagnose problems effectively. By extending RuntimeException, it simplifies error handling by bypassing the need for declaring checked exceptions across all methods that might throw them.
```

## DiagnosisLoadingException.java

The `DiagnosisLoadingException` is a custom exception class in Java that extends the standard Exception class. It serves as an exception type specifically designed to handle errors related to loading diagnosis-related data within a Java application. The constructor of this class accepts two parameters, a message and a Throwable object, allowing for more detailed error handling by wrapping lower-level exceptions and providing additional context about the failure to load diagnosis data.

## DiagnosisNotFoundException.java

The 'DiagnosisNotFoundException' class is a custom exception designed for handling cases where a specific diagnosis cannot be found in a system or application. It is located in the 'core/src/main/java/de/semvox/research/predev/cca/exceptions' package and extends the standard Java Exception class. The purpose of this exception class is to provide more informative error messages when attempting to retrieve a diagnosis that does not exist in the system. By including a custom message with the exception, developers can understand which diagnosis was expected but not found, making it easier for them to locate and fix the issue. The primary responsibility of this class is to serve as an appropriate exception to be thrown when attempting to access or manipulate a diagnosis that does not exist within a system by inheriting all the standard error handling functionality provided by Java. The constructor of 'DiagnosisNotFoundException' accepts a String parameter called 'msg', which is used to provide a custom message that includes information about which diagnosis was expected but not found.

## graph

The `core/src/main/java/de/semvox/research/predev/cca/graph` folder contains Java source code that is part of a library developed by the SemVox research group. This particular package focuses on traversing and managing graph data structures, particularly focusing on Depth-First Search (DFS) algorithms. The `GenericDfsGraphTraverser` class provides a generic implementation of DFS for graphs, which can be used to traverse nodes in the graph based on different criteria such as depth or breadth.

This package is intended to facilitate the conversion process from Fault-Finding tree dialogs (FFT) into geniOs conversational dialogs. The codebase includes a `GraphConverter` class that utilizes the DFS traverser to traverse and convert the graph structure. This can be used in various applications such as natural language processing, machine learning, or artificial intelligence where graph-based data structures are utilized.

Example use case:
Suppose you have a FFT dialog graph represented as a graph with nodes and edges. You want to extract all the paths from node A to node B in this graph using DFS traversal. To achieve this, you can create an instance of `GenericDfsGraphTraverser` and call its `traverse(nodeA, nodeB)` method, passing in the starting and ending nodes respectively. The traverser will then return all the paths from A to B as a list of nodes or edges.

Additionally, the package also includes functionality for querying graph nodes based on certain criteria. For example, you can use the `GraphConverter` class to retrieve specific properties of nodes in the graph such as their labels or attributes. This could be useful for data analysis, filtering, or retrieving relevant information from the graph.

## GenericDfsGraphTraverser.java

```java
import java.util.*;

public class GenericDfsGraphTraverser {

    private Set<DialogNode> visitedNodes = new HashSet<>();
    private Context context;
    private Graph graph;
    private DialogNodeRelations dialogNodeRelations;
    private Visitor startVisitor;
    private Visitor questionVisitor;
    private Visitor solutionVisitor;
    private Visitor subdiagnosisVisitor;

    public GenericDfsGraphTraverser(Context context, Graph graph, DialogNodeRelations dialogNodeRelations) {
        this.context = context;
        this.graph = graph;
        this.dialogNodeRelations = dialogNodeRelations;
    }

    public void traverse() {
        DialogNode startNode = getStartNode();
        if (startNode == null) {
            logWarning("Cannot find START node in the graph");
            return;
        }

        visit(startNode);
    }

    private DialogNode getStartNode() {
        List<DialogNode> startNodes = dialogNodeRelations.getAllByType(NodeType.START);
        if (!startNodes.isEmpty()) {
            return startNodes.get(0); // Assuming there's only one START node in the graph for this example
        }

        return null;
    }

    private void visit(DialogNode dialogNode) {
        if (visitedNodes.contains(dialogNode)) {
            return;
        }

        visitedNodes.add(dialogNode);

        context.setCurrentNode(dialogNode);
        visitNodeBasedOnType(dialogNode);

        dialogNodeRelations.outgoingNodes().forEach(this::visit);
    }

    private void visitNodeBasedOnType(DialogNode dialogNode) {
        switch (dialogNode.getType()) {
            case START:
                startVisitor.visitStartNode(dialogNode);
                break;
            case AUTO_QUESTION:
            case QUESTION:
                questionVisitor.visitQuestionNode(dialogNode);
                dialogNodeRelations.outgoingNodes().forEach(this::visit);
                break;
            case SOLUTION:
                solutionVisitor.visitSolutionNode(dialogNode);
                break;
            case SUBDIAGNOSIS:
                subdiagnosisVisitor.visitSubdiagnosisNode(dialogNode);
                break;
            default:
                logWarning("Unable to handle dialog node type: " + dialogNode.getType());
        }
    }

    private void logWarning(String message) {
        // Add logic for logging warning messages
    }

    public void setStartVisitor(Visitor startVisitor) {
        this.startVisitor = startVisitor;
    }

    public void setQuestionVisitor(Visitor questionVisitor) {
        this.questionVisitor = questionVisitor;
    }

    public void setSolutionVisitor(Visitor solutionVisitor) {
        this.solutionVisitor = solutionVisitor;
    }

    public void setSubdiagnosisVisitor(Visitor subdiagnosisVisitor) {
        this.subdiagnosisVisitor = subdiagnosisVisitor;
    }
}
```

## utils

The `core/src/main/java/de/semvox/research/predev/cca/graph/utils` package in your software project is likely to contain utility classes specifically designed to aid in processing and manipulating graph representations, particularly when dealing with FFT (Fault-Finding tree) dialogs expressed as graphml files. These utilities will play a vital role in converting the FFT graphs into geniOs conversational dialogs.

The `GraphUtil` class is the primary utility class within this package. It serves several purposes:
1. **Data Loading and Parsing**: The `GraphUtil` class provides methods for loading graphml files and parsing their contents to extract relevant data, such as nodes, edges, and attributes of each vertex or edge in the FFT dialog graph. This helps to represent the dialog graph in a more structured format which can be used to create conversational dialogs.
2. **Graph Manipulation**: It might include methods for adding, removing, and modifying vertices and edges within the graph, based on specific requirements of the project such as reorganizing or simplifying the graph before conversion.
3. **Graph Traversal**: `GraphUtil` may offer methods to traverse through the graph, exploring paths between nodes or performing other kinds of graph traversals as needed for dialog processing and manipulation.

### Usage Examples

```java
// Loading a graph from a graphml file
File fftGraphFile = new File("path/to/fft_dialog_graph.graphml");
Graph fftGraph = GraphUtil.loadFFTGraph(fftGraphFile);

// Parsing and extracting relevant data for conversational dialog generation
List<ConversationNode> conversationNodes = GraphUtil.extractConversationalDialogNodes(fftGraph);

// Converting the FFT graph into a geniOs conversational dialog format
genio.setDialogs(conversationNodes); // Assuming there is a method in genio to set the generated dialogs
```

### Why and When to Use It

The `GraphUtil` class is designed to be reusable across different parts of your project, promoting code reuse and maintainability. By encapsulating graph manipulation logic in a single utility class, you can easily integrate graph-related operations into various features or modules of your application, without having to repeat this logic each time it's needed. This makes the codebase more organized, easier to understand, and less prone to errors due to reusability.

Additionally, if changes are required in future development (such as adding new graph manipulation features, improving data extraction for dialog generation, etc.), you can simply modify the `GraphUtil` class, instead of having to edit multiple parts of your codebase. This helps keep your project organized and up-to-date.

## GraphUtil.java

The GraphUtil class in "de.semvox.research.predev.cca.graph.utils" package provides a utility set for working with graphs. The class follows the singleton pattern by having a private constructor, making it impossible to instantiate an object directly.

It contains two methods:

1. cloneGraph(DirectedMultigraph<DialogNode, QAEdge> graph): This method creates a deep copy of a given directed multigraph with edges as QAEdges and returns it. It uses JGrapht's DirectedMultigraph constructor with the QAEdge class argument to create an empty graph, then iterates through all vertices and edges of the original graph to add them to the copied graph. The method assumes that DialogNode and QAEdge classes implement the Cloneable interface.

2. createEdgeIdFrom(String... nodes): this method creates a unique edge id based on two node names by concatenating their names and prefixing it with "edge_id_". It is useful when an edge identifier needs to be created based on node names, for example in saving edge information in databases.

Overall, this class offers robust graph operations such as cloning graphs and creating unique edge ids based on node names.

## rules

The core/src/main/java/de/semvox/research/predev/cca/graph/rules folder contains several classes that are used to manipulate and process FFT (Fault-Finding tree) graphs, which represent conversational dialogs. The purpose of these classes is to perform various rules on the graph nodes and edges, such as removing dummy nodes, skipping next to solution rule, etc. 

The GraphRule class defines an interface for all graph manipulation rules. Each subclass implements this interface and provides specific implementations for a particular type of graph transformation. For example, RemoveDummyNodesRule removes any nodes in the graph that are not connected to other nodes. Similarly, SkipNextToSolutionRule skips over certain nodes in the graph that are typically used as placeholders for user input or clarification.

The RemoveDanglingNodes class provides a method to remove all nodes from the graph that have no outgoing edges. This is useful for cleaning up graphs that may contain unnecessary or orphaned nodes.

Overall, these classes provide a flexible and extensible way of manipulating FFT graphs in order to generate conversational dialogs. By implementing new rules and extending existing ones, developers can customize the behavior of the graph processing pipeline to meet their specific needs.

To use the API for querying the dialog nodes from the graph, you can create an instance of a GraphProcessor class, passing in the FFT graph as a parameter. The GraphProcessor class provides methods such as getNodes(), getEdges(), and getNodeById() that allow developers to query the graph for specific information about its nodes and edges. For example:

```java
GraphProcessor processor = new GraphProcessor(fftGraph);
List<Node> nodes = processor.getNodes();
Edge edge = processor.getEdge("edgeId");
Node nodeById = processor.getNodeById("nodeId");
```

These methods allow developers to retrieve various pieces of information about the graph, including all its nodes and edges, specific edges by ID, and specific nodes by their unique IDs. By using this API, developers can easily navigate and analyze the FFT graphs generated by your library and build conversational dialogs based on them.

## GraphRule.java

The provided Java interface, `GraphRule`, outlines the requirements and functionality for implementing classes that apply rules to graphs using JGraphT library's graph data structures. The core method, `apply()`, takes a graph as an input parameter and applies predefined rules to it. Implementing classes must provide their own implementation of this method to perform unique operations. The interface includes default methods for removing edges and nodes from the graph, which can be overridden if more complex behaviors are required. This interface serves as a blueprint for creating custom rule sets tailored to specific applications.

## RemoveDummyNodesRule.java

```markdown
# RemoveDummyNodesRule Class
The `RemoveDummyNodesRule` class is a graph rule implementation designed to remove all dummy nodes from a given graph. Dummy nodes have the type "dummy" and do not contribute significantly to the overall structure of the graph. The main goal of this rule is to clean up the graph by eliminating unnecessary nodes, enhancing readability, and potentially simplifying its model representation.

## Class Purpose
The `RemoveDummyNodesRule` class contains a method `apply()` that accepts a graph as input and processes it to remove all dummy nodes and their associated edges. This process involves identifying dummy nodes through node type checks (node.getType().isDummy()), collecting incoming and outgoing edges for each identified node, and subsequently removing these nodes from the graph while preserving the integrity of the remaining connections.

## Responsibility & Domain Concepts
- `findNodesToProcess()` method identifies all nodes in the graph tagged as dummy and returns a list of those nodes.
- `processNode(DialogNode node)` takes a single DialogNode object as input and processes it, collecting its incoming and outgoing edges for removal.
- `apply(Graph<DialogNode, QAEdge> graph)` is the main entry point of this rule, orchestrating the entire process of identifying and removing dummy nodes along with their connections from the given graph.

## Code Example
```java
// Creating a sample graph instance
Graph<DialogNode, QAEdge> sampleGraph = ... // Assuming this is properly initialized

// Applying the RemoveDummyNodesRule to clean up the graph
RemoveDummyNodesRule rule = new RemoveDummyNodesRule();
rule.apply(sampleGraph);

// The resultant graph will no longer contain any dummy nodes
```

## Why Use It?
Removing dummy nodes is beneficial for various reasons, such as simplifying complex models or data representations, ensuring cleaner and more intuitive graph visualization, and facilitating further analysis and processing steps. This rule can be applied to preprocess a graph before conducting further operations on it, thereby optimizing the graph's structure for subsequent work.
```

## SkipNextToSolutionRule.java

The provided Java code defines a rule implementation for the Skipping of nodes that are linked to the solution node via an "Weiter" (Next) edge in a graph representation. It serves as a part of a software module responsible for managing graph-based dialog systems. This module defines classes such as `SkipNextToSolutionRule` which analyzes graphs of dialog nodes and edges, filters nodes based on specific criteria, processes them, and removes unnecessary edges from the graph.

The `SkipNextToSolutionRule` class is designed to process a graph by identifying and removing all nodes that are directly connected to the solution node with an "Weiter" (Next) edge. The main method, `apply(Graph<DialogNode, QAEdge> graph)`, iterates through each node in the graph and determines whether it should be removed based on the existence of an edge leading to the solution. If a node meets this criterion, it is added to the list of nodes to remove, along with its associated edges.

The class contains several helper methods:
1. `findNodesToProcess(Graph<DialogNode, QAEdge> graph)`: searches through the given graph for any nodes that have an outgoing "Weiter" (Next) edge leading to the solution node. It returns a list of these nodes for further processing.

2. `processNode(Graph<DialogNode, QAEdge> graph, DialogNode node)`: is called for each node identified as needing removal. It identifies edges connected to the node and adds them to the `edgesToRemove` list, which is used to remove all nodes connected to the solution node.

3. `removeParentToIntermediateEdge(Graph<DialogNode, QAEdge> graph, QAEdge parentEdge)`: Removes an edge from the graph that leads to the intermediate node. It takes the graph and the edge as parameters and simply calls `graph.removeEdge()` to remove the specified edge.

4. `findParentNode(Graph<DialogNode, QAEdge> graph, DialogNode node)`: Finds all incoming edges (parent nodes) of a given node in the graph. This method is used to locate the question node that connects with the solution node through an intermediate edge.

5. `removeWeiterEdge(Graph<DialogNode, QAEdge> graph, QAEdge edge)`: Removes a specific edge from the graph, similar to `removeParentToIntermediateEdge`.

6. `addNewEdgeToSolution(Graph<DialogNode, QAEdge> graph, DialogNode parentNode, DialogNode solutionNode, DialogNode skippedNode, QAEdge originalEdge)`: Creates a new edge connecting the parent node (question) and the solution node directly. It also adds an attribute to the new edge called `SKIPPED_LINK_KEY`, which contains information about the skipped intermediate node and the original edge that led to it.

In summary, this module provides functionality for analyzing and modifying dialog graphs using rules based on certain criteria. Its primary purpose is to help automate certain processes related to dialog systems and improve efficiency in handling user interactions.

## RemoveDanglingNodes.java

The provided Java code file, `RemoveDanglingNodes.java`, is part of a graph processing algorithm that aims to remove dangling nodes from a given directed graph. This class contains two main methods: `processNode()` and `findNodesToProcess()`.

**Class Dependencies:**
- The class relies on the use of a custom graph implementation (`Graph<DialogNode, QAEdge>`) which represents dialog nodes and their corresponding edges in a question and answer (QA) context. 

**Important Domain Concepts:**
- `DialogNode`: Represents individual nodes in the graph, each node contains data relevant to the conversation. 
- `QAEdge`: Represents the directed edges connecting nodes within the graph. 

**Method processNode():**
The purpose of this method is to remove a given node and its outgoing edges from the graph. It does so by adding all outgoing edges of the provided node to a list named `edgesToRemove` and adding the node itself to another list named `nodesToRemove`. this method is called within the process of iterating over each node in a graph, which results in removing any dangling nodes found during traversal.

```java
private void processNode(Graph<DialogNode, QAEdge> graph, DialogNode node) {
    edgesToRemove.addAll(graph.outgoingEdgesOf(node));
    nodesToRemove.add(node);
}
```

**Method findNodesToProcess():**
This method is responsible for identifying nodes in the graph that meet certain criteria, specifically: they are not start nodes and have no incoming edges. It returns a list of such nodes. this list of nodes can then be used as an input to the `processNode()` method to remove these dangling nodes from the graph.

```java
private List<DialogNode> findNodesToProcess(Graph<DialogNode, QAEdge> graph) {
    return graph.vertexSet().stream()
            .filter(node -> !node.getType().isStart())  // Exclude start nodes
            .filter(n -> graph.incomingEdgesOf(n).isEmpty()) // Ensure no incoming edges
            .collect(Collectors.toList());
}
```

**Overall:**
The `RemoveDanglingNodes` class provides a method to identify and remove dangling nodes from a directed graph, which is crucial for maintaining the integrity of the graph structure while processing or analyzing dialogues. It makes use of a custom graph implementation (`Graph<DialogNode, QAEdge>`) and employs Java's Stream API to filter and process the nodes based on specific criteria.

## model

The core/src/main/java/de/semvox/research/predev/cca/graph/rules/model folder in the given project contains a class named SkippedLink.java. This class is responsible for handling the creation of skipped links between nodes in a graph model, which are essential for representing the logical structure and relationships between the different elements in the graph.

The purpose of the SkippedLink class is to provide a way to represent skipped links between nodes in the graph model, which are used to create a logical hierarchy between nodes without actually connecting them physically. This can be useful when dealing with complex graphs where nodes have multiple paths leading to each other, or when the nodes have dependencies that are not directly connected in the graph.

The SkippedLink class has several key properties and methods:

1. Properties:
   - skippedNode: this property represents the node that is skipped by the link.
   - sourceNode: this property represents the node from which the link originates.
   - targetNode: This property represents the node to which the link terminates.

2. Methods:
   - setSkippedNode(Node node): This method sets the skipped node for the link.
   - getSkippedNode(): this method returns the skipped node for the link.
   - setSourceNode(Node node): this method sets the source node for the link.
   - getSourceNode(): this method returns the source node for the link.
   - setTargetNode(Node node): This method sets the target node for the link.
   - getTargetNode(): this method returns the target node for the link.

The SkippedLink class can be used in the following ways:

- To represent skipped links between nodes in a graph model, you can create an instance of SkippedLink and set its properties accordingly. For example, if you want to create a skipped link from node A to node B, you would create a new SkippedLink object and call setSourceNode(A) and setTargetNode(B).
- To query the nodes connected by a skipped link, you can use the getSkippedNode(), getSourceNode(), and getTargetNode() methods. for example, if you want to get the node that is skipped by a specific skipped link, you would call the getSkippedNode() method on that link object.

Overall, the SkippedLink class is an essential part of the graph model in this project, providing a way to represent and query skipped links between nodes.

## SkippedLink.java

The `SkippedLink` class in the provided file is part of a graph-based system for an AI research project. It's designed to represent a link between two nodes in a dialog graph that has been skipped during processing. This class contains two main attributes - `skippedNode`, which is an instance of `DialogNode`, representing the node that was skipped, and `skippedEdge`, which is an instance of `QAEdge`, representing the edge that connects the two nodes and is also skipped during processing. The class constructor initializes a new SkippedLink object with the given skipped node and edge. The `toString()` method overridden in this class outputs a string representation of the SkippedLink in the format "SkippedLink{skippedNode=nodeId, skippedEdge=edgeId}". Additionally, the `getId()` method is assumed to be a part of the `DialogNode` and `QAEdge` classes.

## queryservice

The folder core/src/main/java/de/semvox/research/predev/cca/queryservice contains several Java classes that serve various purposes in the context of converting Fault-Finding tree (FFT) dialogs into geniOs conversational dialogs. These classes form a package with the name de.semvox.research.predev.cca.queryservice, which is part of a larger library or project called CCAPreDev.

1. NlgQueryService.java: This class is responsible for executing queries on the FFT dialogs and generating natural language (NLG) text based on the results. It uses an NLG model to generate the NLG text, which can be used as input for geniOs conversational dialogs.

2. NlgQueryServiceFactory.java: this class is a factory that creates instances of the NlgQueryService class. The NlgQueryServiceFactory has several methods that allow developers to configure and create an instance of the NlgQueryService based on their specific needs.

3. LoadableDialog.java: This class represents a dialog in the FFT system, and it can be loaded into the program for processing. It provides methods for loading dialog data from different sources, such as XML or JSON files.

4. DialogQueryService.java: this class is an example of how to use the NlgQueryService to generate NLG text based on a dialog in the FFT system. It demonstrates how to load a dialog, execute a query on it, and then generate NLG text based on the results.

Overall, this package provides an API for querying the nodes from FFT dialogs and converting them into geniOs conversational dialogs. Developers can use the NlgQueryServiceFactory class to create instances of the NlgQueryService with specific configurations, and then call the query() method on each instance to generate NLG text based on a given dialog in the FFT system.

For example, let's say we have an XML file that represents a dialog in the FFT system. We want to use the CCAPreDev library to convert this dialog into geniOs conversational dialogs. We can create an instance of the NlgQueryServiceFactory class with default configuration, and then call its create() method to create an instance of the NlgQueryService. We can then load our XML file using the LoadableDialog class, and pass it as input to the query() method on the NlgQueryService instance. Finally, we can use the generated NLG text as input for geniOs conversational dialogs.

## NlgQueryService.java

```java
package de.semvox.research.predev.cca.queryservice;

import java.util.Optional;

/**
 * The NlgQueryService interface is responsible for providing natural language generation (NLG) functionality for a given document ID.
 * It provides a method to retrieve NLG associated with a specific document ID, ensuring that if no NLG is found for a particular document ID, it returns an empty Optional.
 * 
 * @since version 1.0
 */
public interface NlgQueryService {

    /**
     * Finds natural language generation (NLG) associated with the given document ID.
     * If no NLG is found for the specified docId, it returns an empty Optional.
     * 
     * @param docId The unique identifier of the document to retrieve NLG for.
     * @return An Optional containing the NLG if found, otherwise an empty Optional.
     */
    Optional<String> findNlgByDocId(String docId);
}
```

In summary, the `NlgQueryService` interface provides a method to retrieve natural language generation (NLG) for a specific document ID. It returns an Optional containing NLG if found, otherwise an empty Optional, adhering to the contract of returning an Optional and not throwing any checked exceptions. The purpose is centralizing NLG functionality and promoting maintainability and scalability by abstracting it from other parts of the system.

## NlgQueryServiceFactory.java

The code file provided is an interface in Java, `NlgQueryServiceFactory`. This interface is part of a larger system called "Core" with the package name `de.semvox.research.predev.ccA.queryservice`. The interface describes a contract that any class implementing it must adhere to.

The interface contains one method: `createFor()`, which takes a `Locale` as an argument and returns an instance of `NlgQueryService`. This method is important because it lets other systems specify which locale they want the `NlgQueryService` to work with, enabling multiple versions of the service that cater to different languages or dialects.

By providing a single method for creating an instance of the `NlgQueryService`, other parts of the system can focus on interacting with the interface rather than the implementation class itself. This provides flexibility and maintainability as the actual logic for creating the `NlgQueryService` might change in future without affecting external systems using this interface.

In summary, the interface `NlgQueryServiceFactory` is a contract that any class implementing it must adhere to, providing a standardized way for other parts of the system to obtain instances of the `NlgQueryService`. This allows them to interact with the service in a predictable and consistent manner, enabling multiple versions of the service based on different locales.

## LoadableDialog.java

The interface `LoadableDialog` defines a contract for loading dialog-related data in an asynchronous and synchronous manner within the package `de.semvox.research.predev.cca.queryservice`. It includes methods for both synchronous (`load(String diagnosisId)`) and asynchronous (`loadAsync(String diagnosisId)`) operations, along with a logging feature in the async method that catches and logs any exceptions thrown during the process. The interface also defines two specific exceptions (`DiagnosisLoadingException` and `DiagnosisNotFoundException`) that can be thrown when loading fails or if a required diagnosis isn't found. Implementing classes must provide an implementation for these methods, ensuring they adhere to the defined contract and handle potential errors gracefully.

## DialogQueryService.java

The code snippet provided outlines a part of a larger system for managing dialog nodes in a conversation-based application. The `DialogQueryService` class plays a crucial role by retrieving information related to dialog nodes, expected answers, and text content based on specified IDs.

**Purpose:**
The main function of the `DialogQueryService` is to query and provide data related to dialog nodes, expected answers in the context of conversational dialog (on-utterance), and text content for a given document ID. This class's methods help in retrieving specific information based on predefined identifiers such as system turn IDs and user turn IDs.

**Class Responsibilities:**
1. **Retrieval of Dialog Nodes:** The `findDialogNodeById` method is used to fetch the details of a dialog node by its unique identifier (nodeId).
2. **Expected Answers:** The `findTargetNodesFromAnswerId` and `findExpectedAnswersAt` methods are provided for retrieving expected answers associated with specific answer IDs and document GUIDs, respectively.
3. **Text Content:** The `getTextBy` method is used to retrieve text content based on a given document ID, providing a default value if the document is not found.

**Code Example:**
```java
// Assuming 'dialogQueryService' is an instance of DialogQueryService
DialogNode node = dialogQueryService.findDialogNodeById("nodeId123");
if (node != null) {
    System.out.println("Found dialog node: " + node);
} else {
    System.out.println("No dialog node found with the given ID.");
}

List<ExpectedAnswer> expectedAnswers = dialogQueryService.findExpectedAnswersAt(new SystemTurnId(1L), new UserTurnId(2L));
if (!expectedAnswers.isEmpty()) {
    System.out.println("Found expected answers: " + expectedAnswers);
} else {
    System.out.println("No expected answers found for the given IDs.");
}

Optional<String> textContent = dialogQueryService.getTextBy("docId123", "Default content");
if (textContent.isPresent()) {
    System.out.println("Found text content: " + textContent.get());
} else {
    System.out.println("No text content found for the given document ID.");
}
```

In this code snippet, we demonstrate how to use various methods provided by the `DialogQueryService` class to fetch dialog nodes, expected answers, and text content based on specific IDs. The examples cover different functionalities including retrieving a dialog node by its identifier, finding expected answers associated with system turn IDs and user turn IDs, and retrieving text content for a given document ID.

**Conclusion:**
The `DialogQueryService` class is a fundamental component of managing the interaction between systems and users in a conversation-based application. It provides methods to retrieve dialog node details, expected answers, and text content based on predefined identifiers, enabling efficient communication and interaction within the system.

## model

The `core/src/main/java/de/semvox/research/predev/cca/model` package contains several Java classes that are essential components of the Conversational Content Automation (CCA) library. The purpose of this package is to provide a comprehensive set of classes for reading, parsing, and manipulating FFT dialogs expressed as graphml files into geniOs conversational dialogs.

1. `TextLocator.java`: This class provides methods for locating specific text within an XML or other text-based data structure. It can be useful when converting FFT dialogs to geniOs format, as it allows the library to extract relevant information from the original source of the text. For example, if a FFT dialog contains a reference to a website, the `TextLocator` class could retrieve the HTML content of that webpage and include it in the final geniOs conversational dialog.

2. `JsonBasedDocumentLocator.java`: this class is responsible for locating and retrieving JSON-based documents used within FFT dialogs. It's useful for processing data or performing operations based on the information contained within JSON files. For example, if an FFT dialog includes a reference to a JSON configuration file, the `JsonBasedDocumentLocator` class could read that file and use its contents to customize the behavior of the dialog.

3. `NlgDB.java`: this class manages a database of natural language processing (NLG) templates used within FFT dialogs. The NLG templates can be used to generate conversational responses based on certain conditions or scenarios. for example, if an FFT dialog needs to ask the user a question and then provide a response based on their answer, the `NlgDB` class would use the appropriate NLG template to generate the response.

4. `FftLanguage.java`: this class provides support for parsing and interpreting FFT dialogs expressed in a specific language or syntax. It's important because it defines how the FFT dialog structure is defined and understood by the CCA library. for example, if an FFT dialog uses a custom syntax that isn't recognized by the standard parser, the `FftLanguage` class could be used to handle that syntax.

In summary, the `core/src/main/java/de/semvox/research/predev/cca/model` package contains essential classes for reading and processing FFT dialogs expressed as graphml files into geniOs conversational dialogs. These classes can be used to extract relevant information from the original source of the text, retrieve JSON-based documents, manage NLG templates, and understand the structure of the FFT dialog language.

## TextLocator.java

The `TextLocator` interface is defined within the "CCA (Compositional Components Architecture)" module and is part of a larger system called predev. It provides a contract for fetching text for documents, allowing developers to create custom implementations based on specific needs. The interface includes a default implementation using a lambda function in its `dummy()` method.

The `TextLocator` interface defines two main methods:
- `getTextForOr(String docId, String defaultText, NodeType type)`, which takes the document ID, a default text, and a node type as parameters and returns the text for the specified document or the default text if not found.
- `getTextFor(DialogNode node)`, which simplifies the process of retrieving text when working with dialog nodes by taking a single argument (the dialog node itself).

Overall, the `TextLocator` interface serves as an essential component in the system for processing and managing text data, enabling developers to customize its behavior based on their specific requirements.

## JsonBasedDocumentLocator.java

The JsonBasedDocumentLocator class in the de.semvox.research.predev.cca.model package serves as an adapter for managing and retrieving text data from a JSON file, utilizing Jackson library's ObjectMapper to convert JSON content into document instances based on 'doctype' field. The LlmOutput encapsulates NLG data within the JsonBasedDocumentLocator class for proper management and access control.

## NlgDB.java

The NlgDB class is designed for managing a database of natural language generation (NLG) data. It uses a HashMap to store key-value pairs where the key represents an entity or context, and the value is a list of NLGs related to that entity or context. The class provides methods such as addNlg() to add new NLGs to the database, get() to retrieve NLGs based on a specific key, and readFrom() to load the NLG data from a file.

The NlgDB class uses the Jackson library for serialization and deserialization of its data into JSON format, while the Log4j library provides logging functionality. The BiConsumer interface is used to pass the key-value pairs of its database to the addNlg() method, which is used to add new NLGs to the database.

## FftLanguage.java

```java
package de.semvox.research.predev.cca.model;

import java.util.Arrays;
import java.util.Optional;

public enum FftLanguage {
    DE("de"), EN("en");

    private final String languageTag;

    FftLanguage(String languageTag) {
        this.languageTag = languageTag;
    }

    public static Optional<FftLanguage> from(String languageCode) {
        return Arrays.stream(values())
                .filter(lang -> lang.languageTag.equalsIgnoreCase(languageCode))
                .findFirst();
    }

    public String lang() {
        return this.languageTag;
    }

    @Override
    public String toString() {
        return languageTag;
    }

    // Additional utility methods or constants can be added here if needed
}
```

## graph

The folder core/src/main/java/de/semvox/research/predev/cca/model/graph contains several Java classes that define the data models and relationships within a graph structure. The purpose of this package is to provide an organized way to represent fault-finding trees as graphs in Java, which can be later exported to different formats such as geniOs conversational dialogs.

1. NodeType: This class defines the types of nodes that can exist in the graph. Each node type corresponds to a specific concept or category within the FFT, and it is used to determine how the node will be represented and interact with other nodes. For example, a "finding" node represents a problem or issue that needs to be addressed, while a "suggestion" node provides potential solutions or recommendations for resolving the problem.

2. DialogNode: this class represents individual nodes within the graph, which correspond to steps in the fault-finding process. Each dialog node has an ID and can have child nodes representing further subdiagnoses or suggestions. The attributes of a dialog node include its type (e.g., finding, suggestion), content (e.g., problem statement or solution description), and any additional metadata needed to complete the dialog.

3. Subdiagnosis: this class represents nested subgraphs within the graph, which are used to represent complex problems that require further investigation or decision-making. Each subdiagnosis has its own set of nodes and edges, and it can be thought of as a smaller FFT being embedded within another one.

4. QAEdge: this class represents directed edges between dialog nodes in the graph, which represent logical relationships between different steps in the fault-finding process. The attributes of an edge include its type (e.g., cause-and-effect relationship or question-answer pair), and any additional metadata needed to understand the meaning of the relationship.

5. ExportFormat: this class defines the formats that can be exported from the graph, such as geniOs conversational dialogs or other types of documents. Each export format has its own set of rules for formatting and rendering the data, which allows it to be easily integrated into different types of systems and applications.

6. AttributeConstants: this class contains constants that define the names of various attributes that can be used within nodes and edges. These constants are used to ensure consistency and consistency across the different parts of the system, and they also provide a way for developers to access specific pieces of information without hardcoding their own attribute names.

In summary, the core/src/main/java/de/semvox/research/predev/cca/model/graph package provides a flexible and extensible data model that can be used to represent fault-finding trees as graphs in Java. The classes within this package allow developers to define different types of nodes, edges, and attributes that accurately capture the structure and content of their FFTs, which can then be exported into various formats for further processing or integration. By using these classes, developers can create a robust and reliable tool for converting FFTs into geniOs conversational dialogs and other types of documents.

## NodeType.java

The `NodeType` enumeration in the given Java code file, located at `de.semvox.research.predev.cca.model.graph`, defines different types of nodes for a graph structure. It categorizes elements such as dialogues, decision trees, and more with specific behaviors and purposes. The enum includes constants like START, QUESTION, SOLUTION, SUBDIAGNOSIS, AUTO_QUESTION, DUMMY, UNKNOWN, which are mapped to their respective types of nodes within the graph structure. This provides an intuitive way to identify different node types for various applications.

Each `NodeType` has its own method for determining whether a specific instance represents it (e.g., isSolution(), isStart(), etc.). The enum also includes a static factory method (`of`) that allows external string representations to be converted to corresponding enum values, making it easy to work with different data sources or inputs in your codebase.

## DialogNode.java

The Java class `DialogNode` represents a node in a dialogue graph and encapsulates various attributes associated with the nodes. The class uses a `HashMap` to store custom attributes for flexibility in adding any additional metadata to dialog nodes.

**Constructor:**

- `public DialogNode(String id)`: Constructs a new `DialogNode` instance with a unique identifier.

**Methods:**

1. **getAttributeValue(String key)**: Retrieves the value of an attribute with the given `key`. If the attribute is not found, it returns an empty string.
2. **setAttributeValue(String key, Object value)**: Sets the value for an attribute identified by the given `key`.
3. **removeAttribute(String key)**: Removes the attribute associated with the given `key`.

**Static Fields:**

- `OBJECT_TYPE_ATTR`, `TYPE_ATTR`, and `NAME_ATTR` are constant strings representing keys for different types of attributes.

**Static Methods:**

1. **getGuid()**: Generates a globally unique identifier (GUID) using a secure random number generator, ensuring that it is not already present in the existing GUIDs set.
2. **sanitizeNodeAndEdgeNames(String name)**: Sanitizes node and edge names by replacing spaces with underscores to ensure compatibility with certain naming conventions.

**Overridden Methods:**

1. `toString()`: Returns a string representation of the `DialogNode`, including its attributes, document ID, GUID, and name.

**Static Nested Class:**

- `DefaultAttribute`: A static nested class representing an attribute with a value and type, used to store attributes in the node's `HashMap`.

Overall, this Java class provides a flexible way to manage dialog nodes by allowing attributes to be added, retrieved, and modified.

## Subdiagnosis.java

The provided Java code snippet is from a class named `Subdiagnosis` located in the package `de.semvox.research.predev.cca.model.graph`. This class represents a specific diagnosis or condition derived from dialog interactions, with unique properties like a document GUID, content, and name.

The class is initialized with a document GUID (documentGuId) and a content string (thingContent). The 'name' property is also set based on the content, but in this case, it is identical to the content. The class provides two constructors: one that takes a document GUID and content as parameters, and another that takes a `DialogNode` instance from which to derive the subdiagnosis information. The `from(DialogNode node)` method creates a new `Subdiagnosis` instance, extracting relevant document and name information from the provided `node`.

The class is designed to represent a diagnosis or condition in a dialog-based application, providing necessary information for further processing or reference. The code snippet includes getter methods to access the content, GUID, and sanitized name of a subdiagnosis instance, as well as equality and hashCode implementations for object comparison and a toString method for string representation.

```

This Java class `QAEdge` is part of a graph data structure used in semantic voxels research projects. It represents an edge between two nodes in the graph, with methods for managing attributes associated with the edge. The class provides getters and setters for retrieving and setting attribute values, as well as copying attributes from another `QAEdge` object. It also includes a method for retrieving the skipped link associated with the edge if it exists.

## ExportFormat.java

The ExportFormat enum in the Java file "core/src/main/java/de/semvox/research/predev/cca/model/graph/ExportFormat.java" defines several formats for exporting data from an application, providing flexibility in how data is presented or utilized externally. The enum includes five constants representing different file formats:

- PNG: Portable Network Graphics (PNG) format suitable for exporting images. It's a lossless format that maintains all color information without any data loss. This format is commonly used by image editing and viewing programs like Adobe Photoshop, GIMP, and Inkscape.

- CONSOLE: Output to the console, typically for debugging or quick viewing purposes. It's a simple, readable text format that directly displays data values expressed in JSON notation. this format is useful during development and testing phases when we need to verify or inspect some data.

- DOT: The DOT language format used with graph description languages like Graphviz. It allows us to export our graph structure into a text file that can be read and manipulated by external tools like Graphviz. This format is useful when we need to visualize complex relationships between objects or concepts within our application.

- JSON: JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) format for transmitting data between a server and web application. It's a lightweight data-interchange format that's easy for humans to read and write, easy for machines to parse and generate, and uses human-readable text to transmit data values expressed in JSON notation. this format is useful when we need to store or exchange structured data within our application.

- SVG: Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) format for exporting vector images. It allows us to create scalable images that can be displayed at any size without losing quality or pixelation. It's a vector-based format that represents an image using mathematical shapes and lines instead of pixels. SVG images are resolution-independent, meaning they scale up or down smoothly without losing detail or clarity. this format is useful when we need to create high-quality visualizations of complex data or graphics within our application.

## AttributeConstants.java

The `AttributeConstants` class in the file core/src/main/java/de/semvox/research/predev/cca/model/graph/AttributeConstants.java serves as a container for constant values used as attribute keys throughout the application. It ensures that attribute keys are consistent, reducing errors due to typos by providing a single point of reference for modifying attribute key names. The `NAME` constant represents the attribute key "name", which might be used to refer to the name property of objects within the application, ensuring consistency across various components that handle or display named entities. This class is not intended to be instantiated or extended and provides no methods.

## node

The core/src/main/java/de/semvox/research/predev/cca/model/graph/node package contains two main classes, DialogNodeRelations and Link. These classes are part of a graph data structure that represents fault-finding trees in the context of geniOs conversational dialogs.

DialogNodeRelations class:
The DialogNodeRelations class is responsible for managing the relationships between nodes in the graph. It provides methods to add, remove and retrieve links between nodes, as well as get the parent node of a given node, and get all child nodes of a given node.

Here's an example usage of the DialogNodeRelations class:

```java
// Create two new nodes
DialogNode node1 = new DialogNode("Node 1");
DialogNode node2 = new DialogNode("Node 2");

// Create a link between the two nodes
Link link = new Link(node1, node2);

// Add the link to the graph
dialogNodeRelations.addLink(link);

// Get the parent of node2 (which should be node1)
DialogNode parent = dialogNodeRelations.getParent(node2);

// Get all child nodes of node1
List<DialogNode> children = dialogNodeRelations.getChildren(node1);
```

Link class:
The Link class represents a connection between two nodes in the graph. It has two properties, source and target, which are both instances of DialogNode. The constructor takes these two nodes as parameters when creating a new link.

Here's an example usage of the Link class:

```java
// Create a new link between node1 and node2
Link link = new Link(node1, node2);
```

In summary, the DialogNodeRelations and Link classes form a graph data structure that can be used to represent fault-finding trees in geniOs conversational dialogs. The DialogNodeRelations class provides methods for managing relationships between nodes, while the Link class represents a connection between two nodes. These classes are essential components of the project and are used extensively throughout its functionality.

## DialogNodeRelations.java

This Java code snippet provides a comprehensive representation of the `DialogNodeRelations` class within the context of a conversational agent application. It includes details on various methods that analyze dialog nodes and their relationships in the graph structure. The class provides functionality to identify whether a node is a start node, retrieve outgoing links, obtain possible answer keys, determine the parent start node, obtain the type of a node, and fetch its parent (if present).

## Link.java

The `Link` class is defined within the package `de.semvox.research.predev.cca.model.graph.node`. It represents a link between two nodes in a graph, where each link consists of a source node, an edge, and a target node. The class provides a constructor to create links with specific source and target nodes, along with methods for accessing the source and target nodes.

It also includes a static method `idOf` that takes a `DialogNode` and an `QAEdge`, concatenates their IDs, and returns the resulting unique identifier for the link. The class is marked as `final`, meaning it cannot be subclassed, and no interfaces are implemented.

Additionally, there's a static constant `EMPTY` which represents an empty link, created with default values for source, edge, and target nodes. This constant is available for use in various parts of the application where such instances may be needed.

## document

The core/src/main/java/de/semvox/research/predev/cca/model/document folder contains classes that are essential to the functionality of the library for converting FFT dialogs into geniOs conversational dialogs. The package provides a set of tools and abstractions for working with documents, making it easier to handle and manipulate data related to documents.

1. AutomaticQuestionType: This class defines a set of constants representing different types of automatic questions that can be asked in a conversation. It includes values like "INFORMATION_REQUEST", "CONFIRMATION_REQUEST" etc., which can be used to identify and process specific types of user input.

2. FftDocuments: this class is responsible for loading, parsing and storing FFT dialogs in the library. It provides methods like load() that loads an FFT document from a file or string, parse() that converts the loaded data into an internal representation, and store() that stores the processed data back to disk.

3. HtmlTextExtractor: this class is used for extracting plain text content from HTML documents. It uses regular expressions to identify and remove any HTML tags, leaving only the raw text content. This class can be useful in scenarios where you need to extract meaningful information from web pages or other HTML content.

4. AbstractFftDocument: this is an abstract base class for all FFT document types in the library. It provides common functionality like getting document metadata and properties, as well as methods for manipulating the document data.

5. DocumentContent: this class represents the main body of text within a document. It includes information about the content type (e.g., plain text, HTML), the actual text content itself, as well as any additional metadata or formatting information.

Overall, this folder is critical to the library's ability to process and manipulate documents in various formats. The classes here provide a foundation for working with document data, making it easier to extract meaningful insights from dialogs expressed as FFT trees.

Example use case:
Let's say you have an FFT tree representing a user's conversation with the library. You can use the AutomaticQuestionType class to determine what type of automatic question was asked, or the DocumentContent class to access and process the actual text content within the conversation. With these classes, you can write code that analyzes the dialog structure and content, making it easier to extract relevant information for further processing or analysis.

## AutomaticQuestionType.java

The provided code file contains a Java enumeration called `AutomaticQuestionType` which is part of the package `de.semvox.research.predev.cca.model.document`. This enumeration represents different types of automatic questions that can be identified from documents and associate them with specific URIs. The enum contains three instances: `WARNING_LIGHTS`, `MODEL`, and provides methods to retrieve the URI associated with a particular question type. The class has a private constructor that initializes the URI for each instance, ensuring that the URIs are only set during object creation and cannot be changed after that point. The purpose of this enumeration is to provide a convenient way to identify and handle different types of automatic questions in documents, using associated URIs for efficient routing and processing of questions based on their determined type.

## FftDocuments.java

```java
package de.semvox.research.predev.cca.model.document;

import java.util.Optional;

// Abstract superclass for FFT documents
abstract class AbstractFftDocument {
    protected String docId;
    protected String subject;
    protected String summary;
    protected String doctype;

    public AbstractFftDocument(String docId, String subject, String summary, String doctype) {
        this.docId = docId;
        this.subject = subject;
        this.summary = summary;
        this.doctype = doctype;
    }

    // Default constructor calls superclass's default constructor
    public AbstractFftDocument() {}
}

// Represents a dialog document in the FFT system
class DialogDocument extends AbstractFftDocument {
    public DialogDocument(String docId, String subject, String summary, String doctype) {
        super(docId, subject, summary, doctype);
    }

    // Default constructor calls superclass's default constructor
    public DialogDocument() {}

    public Optional<String> getDialogPath() {
        return getBasePath().map(basePath -> basePath + "/" + getCustomPath());
    }

    private Optional<String> getBasePath() {
        // Implementation to find the base path
    }

    private String getCustomPath() {
        // Implementation to determine custom path based on document type
    }
}

// Represents a solution document in the FFT system
class SolutionDocument extends AbstractFftDocument {
    public SolutionDocument(String docId, String subject, String summary, String doctype) {
        super(docId, subject, summary, doctype);
    }

    // Default constructor calls superclass's default constructor
    public SolutionDocument() {}
}

// Refactored version of FftDocuments class
abstract class FftDocuments {
    // Empty constructor for refactoring
}

// Represents an automatic answer document in the FFT system
class AutomaticAnswerDocument extends AbstractFftDocument {
    public AutomaticAnswerDocument(String docId, String subject, String summary, String doctype) {
        super(docId, subject, summary, doctype);
    }

    // Default constructor calls superclass's default constructor
    public AutomaticAnswerDocument() {}
}

// Represents a generic FFT document in the system
class GenericFftDocument extends AbstractFftDocument {
    public GenericFftDocument(String docId, String subject, String summary, String doctype) {
        super(docId, subject, summary, doctype);
    }

    // Default constructor calls superclass's default constructor
    public GenericFftDocument() {}
}
```
This Java code defines several classes that represent different types of documents within an FFT system. The `AbstractFftDocument` class serves as a common base for dialog and solution documents, providing shared functionality such as initializing document properties and retrieving base paths. Each subclass (`DialogDocument`, `SolutionDocument`) extends this class with its own specific methods. The `AutomaticAnswerDocument` and `GenericFftDocument` classes also extend the `AbstractFftDocument` class but have different implementations of certain functionalities.

The `FftDocuments` class is a placeholder that should be refactored to remove unnecessary code and improve readability.

## HtmlTextExtractor.java

The `HtmlTextExtractor` class in Java is a part of the de.semvox.research.predev.cca.model.document package and implements the ContentParser interface. This class is responsible for extracting content from HTML documents by using Jsoup, an open-source Java library for working with real-world HTML.

The `HtmlTextExtractor` class provides two static methods to parse HTML content:
1. `of(InputStream inputStream)`: This method reads the input data using Jsoup and extracts textual content from the HTML structure, creating a DocumentContent object representing the extracted data.
2. `of(Path docPath)`: this method takes a Path to a document file as input, reads the document content, parses it using Jsoup, and returns a DocumentContent object with the extracted textual data.

The class has three key responsibilities:
1. Parsing HTML content from an InputStream or a Path: The `of` methods read the input data using Jsoup and extract textual content from the HTML structure.
2. Extracting DocumentContent objects: After parsing the HTML content, the `of` methods create a DocumentContent object representing the extracted textual data in a structured format.

The class also includes code examples demonstrating how to use the `HtmlTextExtractor` class to parse HTML content from an InputStream or a Path and obtain a DocumentContent object containing the extracted textual data.

## AbstractFftDocument.java

The `AbstractFftDocument` class in the given file is an abstract base class for managing Fault Finding Tree (FFT) documents. It provides common functionality such as retrieving document properties, checking document types, and handling exceptions during parsing operations. The class includes a logger for logging purposes using Log4j 2 and uses Jackson annotations for JSON serialization/deserialization of its properties.

The abstract base class contains the following properties:
- `docId`: An integer representing the document ID.
- `subject`: A string containing the subject of the document.
- `summary`: A string providing a summary of the document.
- `doctype`: A string specifying the type of the document.
- `path`: A string storing the path to the document.
- `basePath`: A Path object representing the base path for documents.
- `contentParser`: An instance of a ContentParser interface used to parse and extract content from the document.

The class provides two constructors, each taking in different sets of parameters. The default constructor initializes all properties with empty values. The parameterized constructor accepts the following parameters:
- `docId`: Document ID.
- `subject`: Subject of the document.
- `summary`: Summary of the document.
- `doctype`: Type of the document.

The class also includes a static final logger for logging purposes using Log4j 2, and it uses Jackson annotations for JSON serialization/deserialization of its properties.

The abstract base class serves as a blueprint for creating FFT documents by providing a basic structure with common properties and methods. Subclasses can extend it to implement specific types of FFT documents while maintaining the core functionality defined in the abstract base class.

Domain Concepts Explanation:
- `docId`: Uniquely identifies each document within a system or collection of documents.
- `subject`: Refers to the main topic or focus of the document.
- `summary`: Provides concise information about the content of the document for quick scanning.
- `doctype`: Indicates the type of the document, such as "text", "image", "video", etc., which can be used for categorization or filtering purposes.

Summary:
This abstract base class, `AbstractFftDocument`, serves as a foundation for managing and analyzing various types of documents within an application. It encapsulates common behaviors and properties that all document types share, allowing for consistency and reusability across different parts of the application.

## DocumentContent.java

The `DocumentContent` class in the given Java code snippet represents the content of a document within a document management system. This class encapsulates all essential details about a document, including its title, summary section, content section, and images. The class is final to prevent subclassing, ensuring thread safety and data integrity.

The `DocumentContent` class has four private instance variables: `documentTitle`, `summarySection`, `contentSection`, and `images`. The constructor is annotated with `@JsonCreator`, indicating that it's intended for JSON deserialization. It takes several parameters to initialize these instance variables, including an optional list of images.

The class provides getter methods (`getDocumentTitle()`, `getSummarySection()`, `getContentSection()`, and `getImages()`) and a method called `valueList()` which returns a list of values related to the document content. The class also includes overridden equals() and hashCode() methods for proper object comparison and hashing.

In summary, the `DocumentContent` class is designed as an immutable object to store and manage the content of documents in various applications, including efficient comparison and hashing using overridden methods.

## queryservice

The `core/src/main/java/de/semvox/research/predev/cca/model/queryservice` package contains a set of Java classes that are designed to support querying and retrieval of information about the dialog nodes in FFT (Fault-Finding tree) graphs. These classes provide methods for accessing various properties and attributes of dialog nodes, such as text content, turn IDs, user IDs, and more.

Here's a general overview of what these classes do:

1. `NodeInteraction`: This class represents an interaction between the user and the system in a conversation. It has methods for getting and setting properties such as the turn ID, user ID, and system turn ID.
2. `SystemTurnId`: this class represents the unique identifier for a system turn in a conversation. It provides methods for generating new IDs and validating existing ones.
3. `UserTurnId`: this class represents the unique identifier for a user turn in a conversation. It has methods for generating new IDs, retrieving user-specific information, and validating user input.

To use these classes, you would typically create an instance of one of the classes (e.g., `NodeInteraction`) and then use its methods to perform queries or retrieve information about dialog nodes in FFT graphs. For example:

```java
// Create a new NodeInteraction object for a specific dialog node
NodeInteraction interaction = new NodeInteraction(dialogNode);

// Get the text content of the dialog node
String textContent = interaction.getText();

// Get the turn ID of the user's turn
UserTurnId userTurnId = interaction.getUserTurnId();

// Get the system turn ID for this interaction
SystemTurnId sysTurnId = interaction.getSysTurnId();
```

In terms of practical examples and use cases, consider a scenario where you have a FFT graph representing a conversation between a user and a system. You can use these classes to retrieve information about each dialog node in the graph, such as the text content, turn IDs, or user input. For example, if you want to generate a summary of the conversation or analyze the user's interactions with the system, you could loop through all the nodes in the graph and use these classes to extract relevant data.

## NodeInteraction.java

The `NodeInteraction` class in the `de.semvox.research.predev.cca.model.queryservice` package is a key component responsible for managing user interactions within a dialog management system. It encapsulates information about an interaction at a specific node, including the expected answers for that node, and provides methods to retrieve and manage these details.

Key features of the class:
- Assignment of a `DialogNode` to the interaction with contextual meaning.
- Tracking of a list of expected answers at the designated dialog node for input validation.
- Retrieval of the question associated with this interaction for prompting users.

The class is structured as follows, including its constructor and methods:
```java
public class NodeInteraction {
    private final DialogNode node;
    private final List<String> expectedAnswers;

    // Constructor
    public NodeInteraction(DialogNode node, List<String> expectedAnswers) {
        this.node = node;
        this.expectedAnswers = expectedAnswers;
    }

    // Getters for dialog node and expected answers
    public DialogNode getNode() {
        return node;
    }

    public List<String> getExpectedAnswers() {
        return expectedAnswers;
    }

    // Other methods like toString(), equals(), and hashCode() may be present but not shown here for brevity.
}
```

To create an instance of `NodeInteraction`, provide a `DialogNode` and a list of expected answers:
```java
List<String> answers = Arrays.asList("yes", "no");
DialogNode node = new DialogNode(1, "Are you sure?");
NodeInteraction interaction = new NodeInteraction(node, answers);
```

This class is crucial for managing user interactions within the system, facilitating dialog flows and validating user responses effectively. The provided documentation details its purpose, key features, and how to create an instance of it.

## SystemTurnId.java

```java
/**
 * Represents a unique identifier for a system's turn within a dialogue or operational sequence.
 * This class encapsulates a string identifier that uniquely identifies each instance of SystemTurnId.
 */
public final class SystemTurnId {

    private static final long serialVersionUID = -8717032950829097022L;

    /**
     * The unique identifier as a string.
     */
    private final String id;

    /**
     * Constructs a new instance of SystemTurnId with the given id.
     * @param id the unique identifier, cannot be null.
     * @throws IllegalArgumentException if id is null.
     */
    public SystemTurnId(String id) {
        Objects.requireNonNull(id);
        this.id = id;
    }

    /**
     * Returns a new instance of SystemTurnId with the given id.
     * @param id the unique identifier, cannot be null.
     * @return a new instance of SystemTurnId.
     */
    public static SystemTurnId of(String id) {
        Objects.requireNonNull(id);
        return new SystemTurnId(id);
    }

    /**
     * Returns the unique identifier as a string.
     * @return the id value.
     */
    public String id() {
        return id;
    }

    @Override
    public String toString() {
        return "SystemTurnId{" +
               "id='" + id + '\'' +
               '}';
    }

    @Override
    public boolean equals(Object o) {
        if (this == o) return true;
        if (!(o instanceof SystemTurnId)) return false;
        SystemTurnId that = (SystemTurnId) o;
        return id.equals(that.id);
    }

    @Override
    public int hashCode() {
        return Objects.hash(id);
    }
}
```

This Java class `SystemTurnId` serves as a unique identifier for system turns in dialogue or operational sequences, encapsulating a string identifier that uniquely identifies each instance. The constructor and factory method ensure that an identifier is provided upon object creation, and the getter method allows access to the id value. Overridden methods ensure proper comparison of instances based on their id values.

## UserTurnId.java

```java
package de.semvox.research.predev.cca.model.queryservice;

import java.util.Objects;

final class UserTurnId {
    private final String id;

    public UserTurnId(String id) {
        this.id = Objects.requireNonNull(id, "Identifier must not be null");
    }

    public static UserTurnId of(String id) {
        return new UserTurnId(id);
    }

    @Override
    public String toString() {
        return "UserTurnId{" +
                "id='" + id + '\'' +
                '}';
    }

    @Override
    public boolean equals(Object o) {
        if (this == o) return true;
        if (o == null || getClass() != o.getClass()) return false;
        UserTurnId that = (UserTurnId) o;
        return id.equals(that.id);
    }

    @Override
    public int hashCode() {
        return id.hashCode();
    }

    public String id() {
        return id;
    }
}
```

This Java class `UserTurnId` is part of a larger system for managing user turns in a dialogue or interaction context. It provides unique identifiers for each user turn and ensures that they are immutable, making it suitable for read-only scenarios where the identifier cannot be altered. The class includes a static factory method to create new instances from string identifiers and overrides equals() and hashCode() methods for correct behavior in collections. The `id()` method is provided for accessing the user turn's identifier outside of the class.

## llm

The `core/src/main/java/de/semvox/research/predev/cca/llm` folder in the given software project contains Java source code files that are part of a library designed to convert FFT (Fault-Finding tree) dialogs into geniOs conversational dialogs. These files provide classes and methods for parsing, analyzing, and manipulating the graphml format used by the FFT dialog system.

The `LlmTemplate.java` file contains classes that represent templates for generating geniOs dialogs. It includes a class named `LlmTemplate`, which provides methods for defining the structure of a conversational template, including the order of dialog nodes and their contents. Additionally, there is a `LlmMessage` class that represents individual messages within a dialog and includes functionality to generate the textual content of these messages based on the specified templates.

To use this library, developers would need to create instances of the `LlmTemplate` class, define the structure and content of their desired conversational template, and then use the `LlmMessage` class to generate the textual representation of the dialog nodes according to the defined templates. 

The practical examples could be as follows:

1. Creating a new conversation template with two dialog nodes:
```java
// Create a new LlmTemplate instance
LlmTemplate template = new LlmTemplate();

// Define the first dialog node
template.addNode("Welcome");

// Add textual content to the first dialog node
LlmMessage message1 = new LlmMessage(template, "Welcome! How can I assist you today?");

// Define the second dialog node
template.addNode("HelpRequest");

// Add textual content to the second dialog node
LlmMessage message2 = new LlmMessage(template, "I'm having trouble with [insert specific issue].");

// Generate the textual content of the conversation
String dialogText = message1.getText() + "\n" + message2.getText();
```
In this example, we first create a new `LlmTemplate` instance and define two dialog nodes: "Welcome" and "HelpRequest". We then add textual content to these nodes using the `LlmMessage` class, which generates the text based on the specified templates. Finally, we concatenate the generated text for each node into a complete conversation.

2. Querying dialog nodes from the graph:
```java
// Assuming that the graph is already loaded and parsed into a suitable data structure (e.g., Graph object)
Graph graph = ...;

// Get the first child of the root node in the graph
Node childNode = graph.getFirstChild(graph.getRoot());

// Check if the first child node has the label "Welcome"
if ("Welcome".equals(childNode.getLabel())) {
    System.out.println("Found a 'Welcome' dialog node.");
} else {
    System.out.println("No 'Welcome' dialog node found.");
}
```
In this example, we assume that the FFT dialog graph is already loaded into memory and parsed into a suitable data structure (in this case, a `Graph` object). We then retrieve the first child of the root node in the graph and check if it has the label "Welcome". If it does, we print a message indicating that we found a 'Welcome' dialog node. Otherwise, we print a message indicating that no such node was found.

## LlmTemplate.java

The `LlmTemplate` class is a final Java class that manages and manipulates template strings for Large Language Model (LLM) messages. It provides static methods for creating instances from string representations or resource files, as well as an API for replacing variables within the templates. The class maintains a private constructor and uses a map to store variable replacements made in the template.

To create an instance from a file path:
1. Open the file using `LlmTemplate.fromPath(String)`.
2. Read all lines of the file into a `String` and parse the content using a `TomlParser`.
3. Create an `LlmTemplate` instance with the parsed content.

To create an instance from a string:
1. Parse the input string using a `TomlParser`.
2. Create an `LlmTemplate` instance with the parsed message.

Instances of `LlmTemplate` provide methods for replacing variables in the template, as well as generating an `LlmMessage` based on replaced variables.

## LlmMessage.java

```markdown
The `LlmMessage` class is a final class designed to represent a message from the Large Language Model (LLM). It encapsulates system, user, and assistant messages related to an LLM interaction. This class provides methods to create new instances with specific messages for each context, as well as accessors to retrieve these messages.

To ensure security and maintain data integrity, all message fields are immutable, preventing direct modification from outside the class. The `toString()` method is overridden to generate a human-readable string representation of an `LlmMessage`, combining all relevant messages into a single line for easy display or logging.

An additional static final instance, `EMPTY`, is provided as a convenience for scenarios where no specific message is required. This constant represents an empty message with all fields set to empty strings, allowing callers to avoid null checks and directly use the EMPTY instance when necessary.
```

## model

The `core/src/main/java/de/semvox/research/predev/cca/llm/model` folder contains three Java classes: TomlParser, TomlSection, and TomlData. These classes are part of a library that reads and processes data in a specific file format called Toml (Tom's Obvious, Minimal Language). Toml is used to store configuration settings in a simple, human-readable format.

The purpose of these classes is to provide an API for working with Toml files. Toml files are commonly used in the context of build systems and project configurations, and they can be used to store data such as project names, versions, and dependencies.

TomlParser is responsible for reading and parsing a Toml file into an object graph that represents the contents of the file. This object graph can then be queried using the TomlSection and TomlData classes. 

For example, given a Toml file with the following content:

```
[project]
name = "My Project"
version = "1.0.0"
description = "A sample project for my research."

[dependencies]
java-library = "1.2.3"
```

We can use the TomlParser class to read and parse the file, and then query the resulting object graph using the TomlSection and TomlData classes:

```java
TomlFile file = new TomlFile("path/to/toml/file");
TomlTable table = file.read();
TomlSection section = table.getSection("project");
String projectName = section.getData("name").asString();
```

The TomlParser class provides a simple, high-level interface for working with Toml files. It abstracts away the complexities of reading and parsing Toml files, allowing developers to focus on building applications that work with this data.

In addition to providing an API for querying Toml files, these classes also serve as the foundation for building larger components of the library, such as a graph-to-dialog conversion tool. The TomlParser class can be used to read and parse Toml files into a data model that can then be used by other components in the library.

Overall, the `core/src/main/java/de/semvox/research/predev/cca/llm/model` folder provides a flexible, easy-to-use API for working with Toml files that can be used to build a variety of applications.

## TomlParser.java

This code file is for a TomlParser class within the context of an LLM (Language Model) module in a Java application. The TomlParser class is responsible for parsing TOML formatted text files into structured data that can be used by the application.

The `TomlData` class represents the parsed data in a hierarchical structure, and the TomlParser class initializes an instance of this class to hold the parsed data. The parse() method reads each line from the input reader, checks for section headers or key-value pairs, and adds them to the appropriate section in the `TomlData` object.

The `addSectionRecursively` method creates nested sections based on a dot-separated section name. This function is used by the parse() method to handle section nesting in TOML data.

Overall, the TomlParser class provides a convenient way to parse TOML files into structured data that can be easily used by the application.

## TomlSection.java

The TomlSection class from de.semvox.research.predev.cca.llm.model package serves as a data structure for representing sections in a TOML configuration file. It encapsulates data about a specific section, provides methods for adding, retrieving, and modifying values within that section, manages sub-sections, and overrides the toString method for string representation. The class includes constants for an empty section, constructors, getters, setters, and default value retrieval methods.

## TomlData.java

The provided Java class `TomlData` is a data structure that organizes information in key-value pairs where each value can be another nested `TomlSection`. The purpose of this class is to handle the conversion between TOML (a configuration file format) and the `TomlData` object. It's a key-value store where keys can point to either individual values or other nested `TomlSection` objects.

The class provides the following methods:

1. `getSection(String key)`: This method returns the `TomlSection` associated with the given key. If the section does not exist, it returns null.
2. `getValue(String keyPath)`: this method retrieves a value from within this `TomlData`. It accepts a string in the format "key1.key2.key3" representing nested keys, and returns the corresponding value as a String. If the path does not exist, it returns an empty string.
3. `addSection(String key, TomlSection section)`: This method adds a new `TomlSection` to the current `TomlData`. It takes a key and the `TomlSection` object as arguments.

These methods are essential for handling nested structures in TOML files, allowing you to extract specific values or navigate through sections of data efficiently.

## utils

The folder core/src/main/java/de/semvox/research/predev/cca/utils contains several Java classes that provide various utility functions for processing FFT dialogs and generating conversational dialogs in geniOs format. These utilities include:

1. `ReaderUtils.java`: This class provides methods for reading files from disk, such as XML or CSV files. It also includes a method for parsing FFT (Fault-Finding Tree) dialogs from graphml files.

2. `FileUtils.java`: this class contains utility methods for working with files and directories, such as creating new files, reading file contents, and moving or deleting files.

3. `Constants.java`: this class contains constants used throughout the project, such as file names, folder names, and system properties.

4. `FileStructureUtils.java`: this class provides methods for working with file and directory structures, such as traversing directories, finding specific files, and copying or moving files.

5. `StringUtils.java`: This class includes various utility methods for working with strings, such as converting to upper/lower case, removing whitespace, and comparing strings.

6. `ListUtils.java`: this class provides methods for working with lists, such as sorting a list of strings or adding elements to a list at specific positions.

These classes work together to perform various tasks such as parsing FFT dialogs from graphml files, reading CSV and XML files, and creating geniOs conversational dialogs. The utility functions in these classes are used by other parts of the project, including controllers, services, and repositories, to implement the necessary functionality.

Here are some practical examples of how to use these utilities:

- `ReaderUtils`: To read an XML file from disk and parse it as a FFT dialog, you can call the `readGraphmlFile()` method in `ReaderUtils`. This will return an object representing the parsed dialog structure. You can then access individual elements of the dialog using methods like `getQuestion()`, `getAnswer()`, etc.

- `FileStructureUtils`: To find all CSV files in a specific directory, you can call the `findFiles()` method in `FileStructureUtils`. This will return a list of file objects representing all CSV files found in the specified directory and its subdirectories. You can then process each file using methods like `readCsvFile()`, which reads the contents of the file as a string and returns a list of strings containing individual lines of data.

- `StringUtils`: To convert a string to uppercase, you can call the `toUpperCase()` method in `StringUtils`. This will return a new string with all characters converted to uppercase. You can also use other methods like `trim()`, which removes leading and trailing whitespace from a string, or `replaceAll()`, which replaces all occurrences of a regular expression pattern in a string with a specified replacement string.

- `ListUtils`: To add an element to a list at specific position, you can call the `add()` method in `ListUtils`. this will modify the original list by adding the new element at the given position. You can also use other methods like `sort()`, which sorts a list of strings alphabetically and returns a new sorted list, or `remove()``, which removes an element from the list based on its value or index.

## ReaderUtils.java

The `ReaderUtils` class is a utility class that provides static methods for creating `BufferedReader` objects from various sources such as files, input streams, and strings. The class is designed to be private so it cannot be directly instantiated. Instead, the static methods are used to create reader objects. 

The `readerFrom(Path path)` method takes a file path as an argument and returns a `BufferedReader` object for reading from that file. It utilizes the `Files.newBufferedReader()` method which creates a `BufferedReader` from the given file, wrapping it in a `BufferedInputStream` and a `FileInputStream`.

The `readerFrom(InputStream inputStream)` method takes an `InputStream` as an argument and returns a `BufferedReader` object for reading from that stream. It first checks if the `inputStream` is not null using `Objects.requireNonNull()` method and then creates a new `BufferedReader` with UTF-8 encoding.

The `readerFrom(String text)` method takes a string as an argument and returns a `BufferedReader` object for reading from that string. It uses `StringReader` to wrap the string in a `BufferedReader`.

Overall, this utility class provides a convenient way of creating readers for different sources by using its static methods. The methods are encapsulated within this class to facilitate reusability and maintainability.

## FileUtils.java

The Java `FileUtils` class in package `de.semvox.research.predev.cca.utils` provides a wide range of utility methods for working with files and resources within an application. Below is a comprehensive list of the methods available in this class, along with brief descriptions:

1. **Method searchFileRecursively**
```java
public static Optional<Path> searchFileRecursively(Path parentDir, String relativePath) {
    // Searches for a file starting from 'parentDir' and returns an Optional containing the absolute path if found; otherwise, returns an empty Optional.
}
```

2. **Method loadFromResource**
```java
public static InputStream loadFromResource(String resource) {
    // Loads a resource from the classpath as an input stream. The resource is specified by 'resource', which should be a path within the classpath.
}
```

3. **Method doesNotExist**
```java
public static boolean doesNotExist(Path path) {
    // Checks if the provided 'path' does not exist on the file system. Returns true if the path is null or does not exist; otherwise, returns false.
}
```

4. **Interface FinderCriteria**
- `public static Predicate<Path> endsWith(String extension)`: Matches files ending with a given extension and returns a predicate function.
- `public static Predicate<Path> doesNotContain(String subPath)`: Matches files that do not contain the specified subpath and returns a predicate function.

5. **Method changeFileNameTo**
```java
public static Path changeFileNameTo(Path path, Function<String, String> renamer) {
    // Changes the filename of the given 'path' using a provided 'renamer' function and returns the new path with the updated filename.
}
```

6. **Class ProjectFileSearch**
- `public static Optional<Path> searchFile(String projectFilePath)`: Searches for a file within a project structure based on its relative path. The path starts with "project:" followed by the relative file path, and returns an Optional containing the absolute path if found; otherwise, returns an empty Optional.

In conclusion, the `FileUtils` class in the package `de.semvox.research.predev.cca.utils` offers a range of utility functions for handling files and resources within an application. The methods such as `searchFileRecursively`, `loadFromResource`, `doesNotExist`, `FinderCriteria`, and `changeFileNameTo` are designed to facilitate various file operations, while the `ProjectFileSearch` class provides functionality for locating files within a project structure.

## Constants.java

```java
package de.semvox.research.predev.cca.utils;

public final class Constants {

    // URIs related to the conversational AI system
    public static final String TRIGGER_URI = "FftUris[subDialogTriggerUri]";
    public static final String WARNING_LIGHT_SERVICE_URI = "<warningLightServiceUri>";
    public static final String MODEL_SERVICE_URI = "<modelServiceUri>";
    public static final String INTERACTION_UPDATE_URI = "<interactionUpdateUri>";
    public static final String MAIN_DIALOG_URI = "FftUris[mainDialogTrigger]";

    // Text strings used throughout the system
    public static final String DEV_TEXT = "<devText>";
    public static final String USER_TURN_ID = "User";
    public static final String SYSTEM_TURN_ID = "System";
    public static final String DIALOG_ID = "<dialogId>";

    // Other important parameters and identifiers
    public static final String UNDERSTAND_ALL = "<understandAll>";
    public static final String GRAPHML_EXT = ".graphml";
    public static final String CONVERSATION_PACKAGE = "de.semvox.research.predev.cca.conversation";
    public static final String IMPORT_NAME = "<importName>";
    public static final String NEXT_NAME = "<nextName>";
    public static final String SKIPPED_LINK_KEY = "skippedLinkKey";

    // Private constructor to prevent instantiation outside this package
    private Constants() {}
}
```

This Java code defines a utility class named `Constants` that holds various constant values used throughout an application related to the Conversational Commonality Assistant (CCA). The constants are organized into specific categories and include URIs, service names, text strings, and other parameters crucial for CCA's functionality. The private constructor ensures that instances of this class cannot be created outside its own package, providing a single point of access for all operations related to the `Constants` class.

## FileStructureUtils.java

The `FileStructureUtils` class in the specified Java code file is a utility class that provides static methods for handling file and directory paths in a specific context related to dialog systems. It includes various utility methods such as resolving paths, extracting identifiers from file names, and checking if paths point to specific file types. The class is part of the `de.semvox.research.predev.cca.utils` package and has its own package declaration.

The class contains a private constructor that prevents instances from being created directly. It defines constants like `DOC_LIST_JSON`, which holds the filename for the DocList JSON file, and static methods to check if a given path points to a DocList or single GraphML file (`IsDocListPath` and `IsSingleGraphPath`).

The main functionality of the class comes from its static methods that resolve paths for different types of files related to dialog systems. These include:
- **resolveDocListForLanguage(Path input, Locale locale)**: This method takes a path and a locale as inputs and returns the resolved path to the DocList JSON file for the specified language by appending the language's ISO 639-1 code (lowercase) followed by "json" to the base path.
- **resolveDocListForGerman(Path input)**: a specific method that resolves the path to the DocList JSON file for the German language, using the `resolveDocListForLanguage()` method.

Other utility methods include:
- **getDiagnosisIdFromPath(Path diagnosisPath)**: extracts and returns the diagnosis ID from the given path by removing a prefix "Diagnosis_" and a suffix ".graphml".
- **resolveDocListFromGraphFile(Path graphPath)**: resolves the path to the DocList JSON file based on the provided `graphPath`, traversing up until finding a 'json' directory and appending 'doc_list.json'.
- **resolveBasePathFromDocListPath(Path docListPath)**: finds and returns the base path by traversing up from the given `docListPath` until it finds a root directory containing a 'json' subdirectory and 'doc_list.json'.

In summary, this utility class provides efficient methods for managing file paths related to dialog systems, making it easier to access and manipulate data files within larger applications or research projects.

## StringUtils.java

The `StringUtils` class contains several static helper methods for performing common string operations such as concatenating strings, generating reaction names from given names, and handling blank strings. It is designed to be used in NLG (Natural Language Generation) applications where it might be necessary to format or manipulate text inputs.

1. `concatName(String... names):`
This method takes a variable number of string arguments and concatenates them with the delimiter "DELIMITER". It uses Java's Stream API for efficient string concatenation, making it possible to work with large amounts of data without worrying about performance issues.

2. `generateUnderstandNameFromOutgoing(List<Link> links):` and `generateUnderstandNameFromIncoming(List<Link> links):`
These methods are used to generate a list of understand names from a given list of "Link" objects. They iterate through each link in the input list, convert it into an understandable name using the `StringUtils.mapToUnderstandName()` method and collect the results into a new list.

3. `reactionName(String name):`
This method takes a string as input and returns a new string that is prefixed with "REACT_". It ensures that the input string is sanitized using the `sanitizeUnderstandNames()` method before being added to the prefix.

4. `stringOrBlank(String str):`
This method checks if the given string `str` is null or blank (contains only whitespace characters). If it is, it returns an empty string; otherwise, it returns the original string. This method can be used to ensure that a string has a value before using it in operations that require non-null values.

Overall, the "StringUtils" class provides a set of utility methods for working with strings in Java, making it easier to perform various string manipulations.

## ListUtils.java

The `ListUtils` class in the provided Java file is a utility class that provides various operations on lists such as converting lists to unique lists, filtering elements by type, and creating type-specific filter functions. This class also utilizes Apache Log4j logging for error handling.

1. The `toUniqueList(List<T> items)` method takes a list of items as input and returns a new list containing only the unique elements from the input list by converting it to a `HashSet`.

2. The `filterByType(Class<?> type)` method takes a class object as input and returns a function that filters objects by type, which is useful for filtering elements in a list based on their type.

3. The `containsAny(List<T> list, Collection<T> items)` method checks whether any item from the provided collection exists in the given list or not.

4. The class contains a private constructor to prevent instantiation of this utility class, ensuring that only static methods can be called from outside the class.

5. This class is useful when dealing with large datasets or complex data structures where efficient and effective data manipulation is required.

The `ListUtils` class also provides two static methods: 

1. The `getRandomItemFrom()` method takes a generic list as input and returns an Optional containing a randomly selected item from that list, which is useful for handling nullable lists or returning a single value from a collection of elements.
  
2. The `getFirstOne()` method also takes a generic list as input and returns an Optional containing the first item in that list, which is useful when you want to safely handle empty lists by returning an empty Optional.

## things

The `core/src/main/java/de/semvox/research/predev/cca/utils/things` folder contains two main Java classes: StringBinding.java and Thing.java, which are part of a software library designed to convert Fault-Finding Tree (FFT) dialogs into geniOS conversational dialogs. 

StringBinding.java:
This class is used for binding string data types in the project. It has two methods:
1. `bind(Object obj, String... keys)` - This method binds a given object to one or more keys. If the object already exists with some other key and you call this method again with different keys, it will replace the previous binding. It is useful for creating connections between objects using unique keys.
2. `unbind(Object obj)` - this method removes all bindings of a given object from the system.

Thing.java:
This class represents an entity in the project, and it is used as a base class for other classes that need to be represented as things in the dialog graph. It has several important methods:
1. `setAttribute(String key, Object value)` - this method sets an attribute of the thing with the given key to the specified value. If the key already exists, it will overwrite the previous value.
2. `getAttribute(String key)` - this method retrieves the value associated with a given key from the attributes of the thing. If the key does not exist, it returns null.
3. `addChild(Thing child)` - this method adds a child to the current thing. The child will be added as a direct child of the current thing in the graphical representation.

The package `de.semvox.research.predev.cca.utils.things` is used for managing data and entities in the dialog system, providing a flexible way to represent things using attributes and connections. The classes provided in this package are essential for creating and querying dialog nodes in the graphical representation of FFT dialogs, which is a crucial functionality for the project.

Practical examples and use cases:
Suppose you have a dialog system where each node represents an action that can be taken by the user. You want to store attributes such as the text of the action, its type (e.g., command, question), and any relevant metadata. To achieve this, you could create a subclass of `Thing` called `Action`, which includes additional methods for setting and retrieving these attributes:

```java
public class Action extends Thing {
    private String text;
    private String type;

    public Action(String text) {
        this.text = text;
        this.type = "command";  // Default type is command, can be overridden as needed
    }

    public void setText(String text) {
        setAttribute("text", text);
    }

    public String getText() {
        return (String) getAttribute("text");
    }

    public void setType(String type) {
        setAttribute("type", type);
    }

    public String getType() {
        return (String) getAttribute("type");
    }
}
```

To represent a dialog in the graphical representation, you could create instances of `Action` and connect them using `addChild()` method:

```java
Thing root = new Thing();  // Create root node for the dialog
Action action1 = new Action("Open file");  // Create action 1
Action action2 = new Action("Save file");  // Create action 2

root.addChild(action1);  // Connect action 1 to root
root.addChild(action2);  // Connect action 2 to root
```

Querying the dialog nodes from the graph:

To retrieve all actions from the dialog, you can use a recursive method that checks each node in the graph and retrieves the attributes of `Action` instances:

```java
public List<Action> getActions(Thing node) {
    List<Action> actions = new ArrayList<>();
    if (node instanceof Action) {  // If the current node is an Action instance
        actions.add((Action) node);
    }
    for (Thing child : node.getChildren()) {  // For each child in the node
        actions.addAll(getActions(child));  // recursively check the children
    }
    return actions;
}

List<Action> allActions = getActions(root);
```

By using these classes and methods, you can easily manage data and entities within your dialog system, create a flexible graphical representation of FFT dialogs, and query individual nodes from the graph.

## StringBinding.java

The provided Java class `StringBinding` serves as a key component in a larger system that aims to create structured objects based on predefined schemas. This class encapsulates string values according to a specific format, ensuring immutability and providing factory methods for creating instances.

**Purpose:**
The main purpose of this class is to represent an immutable binding of a string value, adhering to the schema specified by the algorithm's notation. It includes formatting the string in a structured manner and offers convenient factory methods for creating instances of `StringBinding`.

**Important Domain Concepts:**
- Immutable Binding: Ensures that the encapsulated string value remains unaltered after instantiation.
- Semantic Object: Represents a structured object in the form of a semantic representation of the original string value, conforming to predefined schema properties like "stringValue".
- Factory Method: Provides convenient ways to create instances without explicitly calling the constructor, making usage and maintenance more readable and maintainable.

**Code Example Usage:**
```java
// Create an instance of StringBinding with a string value
StringBinding binding = StringBinding.of("exampleValue");

// Access the encapsulated string value using the getter method (not applicable in this context)
String value = binding.value;  // This will throw an error since 'value' is private

// Retrieve the formatted semantic object representation of the string value
String semObject = binding.AsSemObject();  // Returns "object alg#StringBinding { property common#stringValue {\"exampleValue\"} }"
```

In summary, the `StringBinding` class plays a critical role in creating and manipulating structured objects by encapsulating string values according to a defined schema. It ensures immutability and provides a convenient way to create instances of itself using factory methods.

## Thing.java

The Thing interface is located within the package de.semvox.research.predev.cca.utils.things and contains a single method called AsSemObject(). This method belongs to the Thing interface and returns a String type. Its purpose is to represent some kind of thing in a semantic way, meaning it provides a common method for objects that implement this interface to transform themselves into some form of object that can be used in a semantic context (e.g., in a knowledge graph or ontology).

The AsSemObject method exists because it allows the programmer to perform some kind of operation on an object and get back something meaningful in a semantic way, rather than just performing some kind of general operation like getting the value of an object or calling a method. This interface provides a common contract for objects that represent things, allowing them to be easily used in a semantic context by overriding the AsSemObject method.

For example, here is how you might implement this interface in a class:

```java
public class MyThing implements Thing {
    @Override
    public String AsSemObject() {
        // Implement logic to convert the object into a semantic object
        return "my thing";
    }
}
```

In this example, we create a class called MyThing that implements the Thing interface. The AsSemObject method is overridden to provide our own implementation of how to transform the object into a semantic object.

## resource

The folder core/src/main/java/de/semvox/research/predev/cca/utils/resource contains two main classes, FftResourceLoader and TempFolderFftResourceLoader. These classes are used for loading FFT dialogs from various sources into the system and converting them into geniOs conversational dialogs.

The primary function of these loaders is to read in FFT resources (which are graphml files) and convert them into equivalent geniOs conversational dialogs. The TempFolderFftResourceLoader specifically loads FFT resources from a temporary folder, which may be used for testing or development purposes.

The FftResourceLoader class provides a general interface for loading FFT dialogs from different sources. It includes a method called loadFftDialog that takes a String parameter representing the path to an FFT resource and returns an array of FftDialog objects. These FftDialog objects represent individual nodes in the FFT tree and contain information about the prompt, response options, and other properties of each dialog node.

The TempFolderFftResourceLoader class is a specific implementation of the FftResourceLoader that loads FFT resources from a temporary folder. It provides an overloaded version of the loadFftDialog method that takes a File parameter instead of a String. This allows for more flexibility when loading resources from different sources, such as remote servers or other file systems.

In terms of usage and functionality, these loaders can be used in a variety of ways to convert FFT dialogs into geniOs conversational dialogs. For example, they could be used in a larger system that needs to process and analyze FFT dialogs, such as an artificial intelligence chatbot or language translation tool. They could also be used for testing and development purposes by developers who need to quickly load and manipulate FFT resources without having to manually create or modify graphml files.

Overall, the FftResourceLoader and TempFolderFftResourceLoader classes are essential components of the project that help in converting FFT dialogs into geniOs conversational dialogs, making it easier for developers and users alike to work with and manipulate these resources.

## FftResourceLoader.java

The `FftResourceLoader` interface in the given code file serves as a contract for loading Free-Form Text (FFT) resources. It provides methods to retrieve FFT resources from default folders or custom paths, along with an utility method to check if a resource URL points to a JAR file. The interface is defined within the `de.semvox.research.predev.cca.utils.resource` package and is accessible only within that package and its subpackages. It includes two static methods: one for obtaining a default instance using the "de/semvox/cca/ffts" default resource folder, and another for creating instances with a specified resource path. The `getPath()` method returns the file path of the FFT resource, throwing `IOException` and `URISyntaxException` if any error occurs during retrieval or syntax validation. This interface is a fundamental component for managing FFT resources in a Java application, facilitating easy access to various resources while ensuring robust error handling mechanisms are implemented throughout the application development process.

## TempFolderFftResourceLoader.java

This Java class `TempFolderFftResourceLoader` is responsible for loading resources from various sources into a temporary directory on the file system. It provides methods for handling JAR files and IDE environments/directories, along with error logging. The primary functionality of this class is to load resources from different sources and copy them into a specified target directory.

1. `handleJar` method: This static method is responsible for extracting all resources from a given JAR file that match the specified resource path and copying them to the target directory.
   - Parameters: `resourcePath` (String), `resourceUrl` (URLConnection), `targetDirectory` (Path)

2. `loadResources` method: this instance method orchestrates the loading of resources from different sources, starting by getting an enumeration of URLs for the given resource path using the provided class loader. It then iterates over these URLs and calls `handleJar` or `handleIde` depending on whether the resource URL points to a JAR file or not.

3. Class variables:
   - `log` (Logger): an instance of a logging framework like SLF4J used for generating log messages during resource loading activities.

## factories

The core/src/main/java/de/semvox/research/predev/cca/factories folder in the given project is responsible for creating and managing various components required for the conversion of FFT dialogs into geniOs conversational dialogs. Here's a breakdown of the contents and their purposes:

1. JsonDocumentLocatorFactory.java: This class is responsible for creating instances of JsonDocumentLocator, which is used to locate and read JSON files in the project. This class provides a static method `createJsonDocumentLocator()` that takes no parameters and returns an instance of JsonDocumentLocator. When using this factory, developers can simply call the `createJsonDocumentLocator()` method to obtain a new instance of JsonDocumentLocator.

2. DocumentLocatorFactory.java: This class is similar to JsonDocumentLocatorFactory but it creates instances of DocumentLocator instead. The purpose of DocumentLocator is to locate and read different types of documents, not just JSON files. It provides the same static method `createDocumentLocator()` which takes no parameters and returns an instance of DocumentLocator.

3. GraphFactoryImpl.java: this class is a concrete implementation of the GraphFactory interface. It provides methods for creating and manipulating graphs using the Apache Commons Graph API. This factory also has a `fromFftDialog` method, which takes a FFT dialog as input and returns its corresponding graph representation.

4. GraphFactory.java: This is an interface that defines the contract for creating graphs from FFT dialogs. any class that implements this interface can be used to create graphs from FFT dialogs. The purpose of this interface is to provide flexibility in terms of choosing different implementations for creating graphs, such as using different algorithms or data structures.

In summary, these factories are essential components of the project's core functionality. They provide API for locating and reading documents, as well as for creating graphs from FFT dialogs. The GraphFactory interface allows developers to choose between different graph creation implementations based on their requirements. Overall, these factories make it easier to work with the project's data structures and ensure that the conversational dialogs are correctly converted into geniOs format.

## JsonDocumentLocatorFactory.java

```java
package de.semvox.research.predev.ccA.factories;

import java.nio.file.Path;
import com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.ObjectMapper;
import com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.module.SimpleModule;
import org.apache.logging.log4j.LogManager;
import org.apache.logging.log4j.Logger;

public class JsonDocumentLocatorFactory implements DocumentLocatorFactory {

    private static final Logger log = LogManager.getLogger(JsonDocumentLocatorFactory.class);

    @Override
    public DocumentLocator create(Path docListPath, ContentParser contentParser) {
        if (FileUtils.doesNotExist(docListPath)) {
            return DocumentLocator.dummy();
        }
        return tryToCreateDocumentLocator(docListPath, contentParser);
    }

    private JsonBasedDocumentLocator tryToCreateDocumentLocator(Path docListPath, ContentParser contentParser) {
        String content = ReaderUtils.readFileContentToString(docListPath);
        ObjectMapper mapper = new ObjectMapper();
        SimpleModule module = new SimpleModule();
        mapper.registerModule(module);
        Map<String, Object> docListJson = mapper.readValue(content, Map.class);
        return new JsonBasedDocumentLocator(docListJson, contentParser);
    }
}
```

This Java class `JsonDocumentLocatorFactory` implements the `DocumentLocatorFactory` interface and provides functionality to load documents from a JSON file (`DocList.json`) and create a `DocumentLocator` instance using those documents. The class utilizes Apache Commons IO's `FileUtils` for checking if the JSON file exists, reading its content with custom helpers, parsing the JSON data using Jackson, and constructing a `JsonBasedDocumentLocator` with the parsed data. If an error occurs during these operations, it logs an error message and returns a dummy `DocumentLocator` instance instead of throwing an exception.

## DocumentLocatorFactory.java

```java
package de.semvox.research.predev.cca.factories;

import java.nio.file.Path;

public interface ContentParser {
    String parseContent(String content);
}

class HtmlTextExtractor implements ContentParser {
    @Override
    public String parseContent(String content) {
        // Implementation to extract text from HTML content
        return null; // Placeholder return value, replace with actual implementation
    }
}

interface DocumentLocatorFactory {
    default DocumentLocator create(Path docListPath) {
        return new DocumentLocatorImpl(docListPath, new HtmlTextExtractor());
    }

    DocumentLocator create(Path docListPath, ContentParser contentParser);

    static DocumentLocatorFactory dummyFactory() {
        return () -> new DocumentLocator() {
            @Override
            public String getContent() {
                return "Dummy document content"; // Placeholder for dummy content
            }

            @Override
            public Path getPath() {
                return Paths.get("dummy/path"); // Placeholder for dummy path
            }
        };
    }
}

class DocumentLocatorImpl implements DocumentLocator {
    private final Path docListPath;
    private final ContentParser contentParser;

    public DocumentLocatorImpl(Path docListPath, ContentParser contentParser) {
        this.docListPath = docListPath;
        this.contentParser = contentParser;
    }

    @Override
    public String getContent() {
        // Implementation to retrieve content from document located at the specified path using the parser
        return null; // Placeholder return value, replace with actual implementation
    }

    @Override
    public Path getPath() {
        return docListPath;
    }
}

interface DocumentLocator {
    String getContent();
    Path getPath();
}
```
This Java code defines several classes and interfaces related to document locators and content parsing. The `DocumentLocatorFactory` interface is the main class in this package, providing a factory method for creating instances of `DocumentLocator`. It includes default implementations for creating document locators based on only a path or with both a path and a custom parser. Additionally, it provides a static method `dummyFactory()` that returns a dummy instance of `DocumentLocatorFactory` for testing purposes.

The `ContentParser` interface defines a single method `parseContent(String content)`, which all concrete parsing implementations must implement. The `HtmlTextExtractor` class is an example of a concrete parser implementation, using it to extract text from HTML content.

The `DocumentLocatorImpl` class represents the actual locators responsible for retrieving document data based on their paths and content parsers. It implements the `DocumentLocator` interface, providing methods to retrieve content and path information about the located document.

## GraphFactoryImpl.java

```java
package de.semvox.research.predev.cca.factories;

import java.io.IOException;
import java.nio.file.Path;
import java.util.function.BiFunction;

import org.apache.logging.log4j.LogManager;
import org.apache.logging.log4j.Logger;
import org.jgrapht.graph.DirectedMultigraph;

public class GraphFactoryImpl implements GraphFactory {
    private static final Logger logger = LogManager.getLogger();

    @Override
    public DirectedMultigraph<DialogNode, QAEdge> create(Path path) throws IOException {
        return create(ReaderUtils.readerFrom(path));
    }

    @Override
    public DirectedMultigraph<DialogNode, QAEdge> create(Reader reader) {
        DirectedMultigraph<DialogNode, QAEdge> graph = new DirectedMultigraph<>(QAEdge.class);
        GraphMLImporter<DialogNode, QAEdge> importer = new GraphMLImporter<>();

        importer.addEdgeAttributeConsumer((p, A) -> {
            QAEdge edge = p.getFirst();
            String key = p.getSecond();
            String value = A.getValue();

            if (edge != null) {
                edge.addAttribute(key, value);
            } else {
                logger.warn("Edge is null. This should not happen");
            }
        });

        importer.importGraph(graph, reader);
        return graph;
    }

    // ... additional methods and classes are defined in the package structure
}
```

## GraphFactory.java

The provided Java code snippet defines a default interface for creating graphs using a reader and applying rules to them, with three methods: `create(Reader reader, GraphRule... rules)`, `create(Graph<DialogNode, QAEdge> graph, GraphRule... rules)`, and `cloneAndApplyRules(GraphRule... rules)`. The interface is part of the `GraphFactory` class within the package `de.semvox.research.predev.cca.factories`.

**Responsibilities:**
- It defines a contract for creating graphs using a reader and applying rules to them.
- Allows for both direct creation from files or other input streams and more flexible customization through GraphRules.

**Methods:**

1. `create(Reader reader, GraphRule... rules)`:
   - Takes a Reader object providing the graph data and an array of GraphRules as additional parameters.
   - Returns a modified graph after applying the rules.
   - Utilizes the default create method to generate a graph from the Reader and then applies the specified rules.

2. `create(Graph<DialogNode, QAEdge> graph, GraphRule... rules)`:
   - Takes an existing graph and an array of GraphRules as parameters.
   - Returns a modified graph after applying the rules to it.
   - Clones the original graph and applies the specified rules, returning the modified clone.

3. `cloneAndApplyRules(GraphRule... rules)`:
   - Creates a deep clone of the current GraphFactory object and applies all given GraphRules to it.
   - Returns the modified cloned graph after applying all rules.

The provided interface is flexible and abstracted, enabling users to create graphs from different sources using custom rules for node manipulation.

## api

The folder "core/src/main/java/de/semvox/research/predev/cca/api" contains four main classes that are essential for converting FFT dialogs into geniOs conversational dialogs. The purpose of this package is to provide a robust and flexible API that allows developers to interact with the library's functionality in an easy and efficient manner.

1. DocumentLocator.java: This class provides methods to locate documents (e.g., FFT files) on disk or in a database. It can be used to read and parse documents, as well as write them back out in different formats. The main use case for this class is when dealing with large datasets that are stored in multiple locations or databases. For example, if you have a collection of FFT files stored in a SQL database, you could use the DocumentLocator class to retrieve and parse them all at once.

2. ContentParser.java: this class is responsible for parsing the content of documents into usable data structures. It provides methods for converting FFT dialogs into geniOs conversational dialogs, as well as other types of content. The main use case for this class is when you need to extract specific information from a document or perform some transformation on its content. For example, if you want to analyze the sentiment of a given FFT file, you could use the ContentParser class to convert it into geniOs conversational dialogs and then extract the sentiment data from that output.

3. TextProvider.java: This class provides methods for retrieving textual information from documents or other sources. It can be used to access specific pieces of content within a document, as well as retrieve metadata about the document itself. The main use case for this class is when you need to extract textual data that isn't part of the actual content in a document, such as author names or timestamps. for example, if you want to include the creation date of an FFT file in your output, you could use the TextProvider class to retrieve that information and include it within your conversational dialogs.

4. AutomaticQuestionTypeFinder.java: this class provides methods for automatically identifying the type of questions that are being asked in a given FFT dialog. It can be used to generate more meaningful conversational dialogs by providing contextual information about the types of questions being asked, as well as suggesting appropriate responses. The main use case for this class is when you want to create conversational dialogs that are tailored to specific user needs or preferences. For example, if a user asks a question related to their favorite movie, the AutomaticQuestionTypeFinder class can be used to suggest relevant information about the movie and provide appropriate responses based on the user's interests.

In summary, this package provides a comprehensive API that allows developers to interact with the library's functionality in various ways. By using these classes, you can access specific parts of documents or retrieve textual information, as well as convert FFT dialogs into geniOs conversational dialogs and suggest appropriate responses based on the types of questions being asked.

## DocumentLocator.java

The class `DocumentLocator` is an essential component of a system that manages documents and their associated text or images. Its main responsibility is to provide a standardized way to retrieve data from documents, encapsulating the logic for searching and retrieving document data within the domain of dialog management.

- **Retrieval Methods:**
  - `getTextForOr`: Retrieves textual content for a given document ID or returns a default value if not found. It supports both numeric and alphanumeric IDs.
  - `getTextFor`: Similar to `getTextForOr`, but accepts a DialogNode as input, utilizing the former to fetch the text.
  - `getImagesFor`: Retrieves image URLs for a specific document ID.

- **Other Methods:**
  - `getSingleTextFor`: Provides a default method that returns the first line of text found for a given DialogNode, leveraging `getTextForOr` to fetch the text.

The class is designed to be flexible and can adapt to various scenarios where textual or image content needs to be accessed. Its use cases range from retrieving information for display in a dialog system to processing data associated with different document types. This makes it an essential tool for managing and interacting with documents within the context of complex applications.

## ContentParser.java

The provided Java interface `ContentParser` in the package `de.semvox.research.predev.cca.api` defines a contract for parsing HTML content and extracting document information. This interface includes two methods:

- `extractContentFrom(String content)`: Takes an HTML content string as input and returns a `DocumentContent` object, which represents the extracted document information.
  
- `default extractContentFrom(Path docPath) throws IOException`: This is a default method that reads the entire file located at the specified path, converts it into a string using `Files.readAllLines(docPath)`, and then calls the previous method (`extractContentFrom(String content)`) to parse the HTML content.

The interface serves as a blueprint for implementing various parsers that can handle different types of HTML content, such as news articles, product descriptions, or generic web pages. By defining the contract in this way, developers can easily switch between different implementations based on their specific requirements without changing the calling code.

The interface uses `DocumentContent` as an output model to encapsulate the structured information extracted from the HTML. It provides a clear interface for parsing HTML content and extracting relevant information, which is crucial for various text-based data extraction tasks.

When using this interface, developers should be aware that it supports two main operations:
1. Parsing a single string of HTML content
2. Reading an entire file and parsing its contents

This approach simplifies implementing custom parsers by providing a single entry point for processing both types of input data. The `ContentParser` interface can be particularly useful in scenarios where data needs to be processed and analyzed for further processing or storage.

## TextProvider.java

The `TextProvider` interface in the package `de.semvox.research.predev.cca.api` defines functionality for generating text content based on a `DialogNode`. It includes static methods to create default and custom `TextProvider` instances, as well as a default method to retrieve a dummy `DocumentLocator`. The core functionality is defined by the `generate()` method that takes a `DialogNode` as an argument and returns the generated text content for that node.

## AutomaticQuestionTypeFinder.java

```java
/**
 * Provides an interface for determining the automatic question type from a given document identifier.
 * 
 * This interface contains a method `findTypeFrom` which takes a string argument (the document ID) and returns an `Optional<AutomaticQuestionType>`.
 * The method analyzes content or metadata associated with the document ID to determine the type of questions it contains, returning an empty optional if the type cannot be determined.
 */

public interface AutomaticQuestionTypeFinder {

    /**
     * Finds the automatic question type from a given document identifier.
     * 
     * @param docId The document identifier to analyze.
     * @return An Optional<AutomaticQuestionType> containing the determined question type if successful, or an empty optional otherwise.
     */
    Optional<AutomaticQuestionType> findTypeFrom(String docId);

}

/**
 * Implements the AutomaticQuestionTypeFinder interface to provide specific functionality for determining question types from document content.
 * 
 * This class provides a concrete implementation of the `findTypeFrom` method, which uses predefined rules or algorithms to analyze document content and determine the type of questions it contains.
 */

public class MyImplementation implements AutomaticQuestionTypeFinder {

    @Override
    public Optional<AutomaticQuestionType> findTypeFrom(String docId) {
        // Implement specific logic here to determine question type from document content
        return Optional.empty(); // Placeholder for actual implementation
    }

}

/**
 * Demonstrates the usage of the `QuestionClassifier` class, which utilizes an instance of `AutomaticQuestionTypeFinder`.
 */

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MyImplementation MyFinder = new MyImplementation(); // Assuming MyImplementation implements AutomaticQuestionTypeFinder
        QuestionClassifier classifier = new QuestionClassifier(MyFinder);

        Optional<AutomaticQuestionType> questionType = classifier.classifyQuestion("document123");
        if (questionType.isPresent()) {
            System.out.println("The type of the question is: " + questionType.get());
        } else {
            System.out.println("Could not determine the type of the question.");
        }
    }

}

/**
 * Represents a domain concept that can be assigned to a question based on its content or metadata.
 */

enum AutomaticQuestionType {
    // Define possible automatic question types here
}

```

## visitors

The core/src/main/java/de/semvox/research/predev/cca/api/visitors folder contains various Java classes that facilitate the process of visiting and processing nodes in a Fault-Finding tree (FFT) dialog graph. These classes are part of the API for querying the dialog nodes from the graph, providing an abstraction layer for users to interact with the data without directly dealing with graph-related concepts.

1. `GraphVisitors.java`: This class provides a set of predefined visitor patterns that can be used to traverse and extract information from FFT dialog graphs. These visitors are implemented as interfaces, allowing users to define their own behavior for visiting different types of nodes in the graph. For example, a user might want to create a visitor that extracts all the phrases from the graph, or a visitor that retrieves all the dialog nodes with a specific label.

2. `AbstractVisitorContext.java`: this class is an abstract implementation of the `VisitorContext` interface. It provides common functionality for managing visitor patterns and providing methods for traversing the graph nodes. Visitors can extend this class to create their own context implementations that provide additional features or behavior specific to their use case.

3. `VisitableContext.java`: this interface defines a contract for objects that can be visited by visitors. It includes a single method, `accept(Visitor visitor)`, which allows an object to accept a visitor and trigger the appropriate visit operation. Implementing classes should provide specific behavior for accepting visitors and performing their required operations when visiting different types of nodes in the graph.

In summary, the core/src/main/java/de/semvox/research/predev/cca/api/visitors package provides a set of Java classes that facilitate the process of visiting and processing nodes in an FFT dialog graph. The `GraphVisitors` class offers predefined visitor patterns for extracting information from the graph, while the `AbstractVisitorContext` and `VisitableContext` provide an abstraction layer for managing visitor patterns and traversing the graph nodes. These classes form the foundation of the API for querying the dialog nodes from the graph, allowing users to interact with the data in a flexible and extensible manner.

## GraphVisitors.java

The provided Java code defines an interface called `GraphVisitors` which contains factory methods for creating dummy visitors for different types of nodes within a graph. These dummy visitors perform no operations and are primarily used for testing or as default behaviors in the absence of specific visitor implementations. The interface has three static factory methods:

1. `dummySubdiagnosisVisitor` - this method creates a dummy `SubdiagnosisNodeVisitor` that performs no operations when visiting a node of type `SubdiagnosisNode`. It accepts two generic parameters, `T`, representing the type of the context object used in the visitor. The lambda expression within the method represents an anonymous implementation of the `SubdiagnosisNodeVisitor` interface, which takes two parameters: the `node` (of type `SubdiagnosisNode`) and the `context` (of type `T`). In this case, it contains a no-operation block.

2. `dummyStartNodeVisitor` - similar to `dummySubdiagnosisVisitor`, this method creates a dummy `StartNodeVisitor` that performs no operations when visiting a node of type `StartNode`. It also accepts two generic parameters, `T`, representing the type of the context object used in the visitor. The lambda expression within the method represents an anonymous implementation of the `StartNodeVisitor` interface, which takes two parameters: the `node` (of type `StartNode`) and the `context` (of type `T`). In this case, it contains a no-operation block.

3. `dummyQuestionVisitor` - this method creates a dummy `QuestionNodeVisitor` that performs no operations when visiting a node of type `QuestionNode`. It accepts two generic parameters, `T`, representing the type of the context object used in the visitor. The lambda expression within the method represents an anonymous implementation of the `QuestionNodeVisitor` interface, which takes two parameters: the `node` (of type `QuestionNode`) and the `context` (of type `T`). In this case, it contains a no-operation block.

The provided Java code file `GraphVisitors.java` contains two interfaces - `StartNodeVisitor` and `AutomaticQuestionVisitor`. These interfaces serve as templates for defining custom behavior that can be applied to specific types of nodes in a graph structure, such as a dialog system. The `StartNodeVisitor` interface has a single method `visitStartNode(DialogNode node, VisitableContext<T> context)` which is called when encountering a start node in the graph. The `AutomaticQuestionVisitor` interface also has a single method `visitAutomaticQuestionNode(DialogNode node, VisitableContext<T> context)`.

Additionally, the provided Java code file contains an example of how these interfaces can be used within an application:

```java
public class MyStartNodeVisitor implements StartNodeVisitor<MyContext> {
    @Override
    public void visitStartNode(DialogNode node, VisitableContext<MyContext> context) {
        System.out.println("Visiting start node: " + node);
        // Additional custom logic goes here
    }
}

// Usage within the application
MyStartNodeVisitor visitor = new MyStartNodeVisitor();
graph.accept(visitor, new MyContext());
```

The `MyStartNodeVisitor` class implements the `StartNodeVisitor` interface and provides custom logic for visiting start nodes in a graph structure. Similarly, the `MyAutomaticQuestionVisitor` class implements the `AutomaticQuestionVisitor` interface and defines its own custom behavior for processing automatic question nodes in a dialog system's graph.

## AbstractVisitorContext.java

The `AbstractVisitorContext` class in the provided Java file is an abstract base class for visitor contexts used in navigating and operating on a graph. It implements the `VisitableContext` interface and provides common functionality for managing the state and navigation through nodes and blocks of a graph during traversal or analysis processes.

The `AbstractVisitorContext` class serves as a foundation for creating specific visitor contexts tailored to different graph navigation strategies or analysis tasks. It encapsulates the core logic required for visiting nodes, blocks, and managing their relationships within a graph.

The class maintains a current block or node, which it updates when traversing through the graph. It provides a constructor to initialize the starting block and name/identifier for the context. The setter method allows updating the current block during runtime. This class can be subclassed for specific implementations tailored to different use cases.

The `AbstractVisitorContext` class is useful in various scenarios where a common set of functionality needs to be shared among different graph traversal or analysis strategies, such as language processing, semantic modeling, or pattern recognition tasks. It simplifies code maintenance and reduces the amount of boilerplate code required when creating specialized visitor contexts tailored to specific analysis needs.

## VisitableContext.java

This Java interface `VisitableContext` is designed for managing and manipulating state during the traversal through a graph structure, such as dialog nodes in a conversational agent system called "cca". It maintains and manipulates a current block or node, as well as its properties. The interface provides generic type parameters to allow different types of blocks or nodes to be managed.

The methods defined in the interface include:

1. `setCurrentBlock(T currentBlock)` - Allows setting the current block or node context to a given block of any type `T`.
2. `getCurrentBlockAs(Class<? extends T> type)` - Retrieves the current block cast to a specific subclass of `T`, allowing for more specific operations on the retrieved object.
3. `getRootCodeBlockAs(Class<? extends T> type)` - Similar to `getCurrentBlockAs()`, but retrieves the root code block instead, starting from the root node of the graph structure.

In summary, the interface provides a toolkit for managing state during a traversal through a tree-like structure, such as dialog nodes, making it essential for developers working with graph data structures. The methods are annotated with `@Deprecated`, indicating they may be removed in future versions.

## resources



## resources

The folder "resources/src/main/java/de/semvox/research/predev/cca/resources" contains Java source code that is used to implement a specific functionality in a larger software project. The purpose of this code is to process FFT (Fault-finding tree) dialogs, convert them into geniOs conversational dialogs, and provide an API for querying the nodes of the graph represented by these dialogs.

The package `de.semvox.research.predev.cca.resources` is part of a larger library that provides tools for processing FFT dialogs and converting them into geniOs conversational dialogs. The code in this package is designed to be easily integrated into existing software projects, making it accessible for developers without extensive knowledge of the project's architecture.

The `FftScanner` class is a crucial component of the `de.semvox.research.predev.cca.resources` package. It is responsible for scanning and parsing FFT dialogs in GraphML format, converting them into geniOs conversational dialogs, and storing the resulting data in a graph data structure.

Here's an overview of how to use the `FftScanner` class:

1. Create an instance of the `FftScanner` class.
2. Use the `scan` method to load and parse an FFT dialog from a GraphML file.
3. Use the resulting graph data structure to query nodes or perform other operations related to the dialog.

Here's a practical example:

Suppose you have an FFT dialog in GraphML format stored in a file called `dialog1.graphml`. You want to convert it into geniOs conversational dialogs and then query some specific information from the resulting graph data structure. Here's how you would do it using the `FftScanner` class:

```java
import de.semvox.research.predev.cca.resources.FftScanner;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        // Create an instance of FftScanner
        FftScanner scanner = new FftScanner();

        // Scan and parse the FFT dialog from the file
        scanner.scan("dialog1.graphml");

        // Get the resulting graph data structure
        Graph<String, String> graph = scanner.getGraph();

        // Query nodes or perform other operations related to the dialog
        Node node1 = graph.getNodeById("node1");
        System.out.println(node1.getName());  // Output: Node 1 name

        Edge edge1 = graph.getEdgeById("edge1");
        System.out.println(edge1.getLabel());  // Output: Edge label
    }
}
```

In this example, we first create an instance of the `FftScanner` class and then use its `scan` method to load and parse the FFT dialog from a GraphML file. We then get the resulting graph data structure and query some specific information from it using the methods provided by the `Graph` class.

Overall, the purpose of the `de.semvox.research.predev.cca.resources` package is to provide tools for processing FFT dialogs and converting them into geniOs conversational dialogs, making it easy for developers to integrate these tools into their existing software projects. The `FftScanner` class is a central component of this package that provides the functionality we need, and using it allows us to easily query nodes or perform other operations related to the dialog.

## FftScanner.java

The FftScanner class in the Java application "CCA" provides a method `scanFolderAndWalk()` that recursively scans a given base path, runs an FftRunner on each subdirectory (FFT folder), and handles any potential errors. The FftResourceLoader class is used to load resources from the default resource folder of the application, while the FftRunner interface defines the custom behavior for processing each FFT folder. There are two additional methods `scanResourcesAndWalk()` that call `scanFolderAndWalk()` with predefined values for base path and output path, simplifying the scanning process.

## exceptions

The `cli-generation-tool/src/main/java/de/semvox/research/predev/cca/exceptions` package contains a single Java class named `ClientException`. This exception class is part of the CCALibrary, which is used for converting FFT dialogs into geniOs conversational dialogs. The purpose of this class is to provide custom exceptions that can be thrown when something goes wrong during the conversion process.

A `ClientException` is a checked exception in Java, meaning it requires explicit handling by the code that throws it. This is because checked exceptions are a form of runtime exception and they force developers to think about potential issues before their code can run. In this case, the `ClientException` is used to handle any errors that occur during the conversion process.

When using the CCALibrary, developers should use try-catch blocks to catch and handle these custom exceptions. If an error occurs during the conversion process, a `ClientException` will be thrown with an appropriate message. This allows developers to handle potential issues gracefully and provide helpful feedback to the user.

For example, consider the following code snippet:
```java
try {
    ConversationalDialog dialog = CCALibrary.convert(fftDialog);
} catch (ClientException e) {
    System.out.println("Error occurred during conversion: " + e.getMessage());
}
```
In this code, if an error occurs during the conversion process, a `ClientException` will be thrown. We then use a try-catch block to catch and handle this exception by printing an appropriate message to the console.

The `ClientException` class is part of the CCALibrary because it's used to represent errors that occur when using the library. It doesn't contain any logic or implementation, but instead serves as a placeholder for handling potential issues in the code using the library.

## ClientException.java

The ClientException class extends RuntimeException and is located in the package de.semvox.research.predev.cca.exceptions. Its primary function is to represent an exception that occurs during client operations. It takes a Throwable object as a parameter and passes it to its superclass constructor, effectively capturing and storing the cause of the exception. This allows for easy creation and propagation of exceptions across multiple layers of code without the need for explicit catch blocks or checked exceptions.

The ClientException class is used in the following way: If an exception occurs during client operations within a method, it can be caught and rethrown as a ClientException with the original Exception object passed to its constructor. This allows for centralized handling of exceptions that may occur at different points throughout the application, reducing code duplication and improving maintainability.

In summary, the ClientException class provides a simple yet effective way to represent exceptions that occur during client operations in Java. By extending RuntimeException, it automatically becomes an unchecked exception and does not require explicit declaration of a throws clause in the calling method. This makes it an ideal choice for handling unexpected or unpredictable errors that may arise during client operations.

## cli

The `cli-generation-tool/src/main/java/de/semvox/research/predev/cca/cli` folder contains the source code for a command line interface (CLI) tool that is part of the project. The main functionality of this CLI tool is to perform various tasks related to graph generation and dialog creation, such as exporting graphs from FFT dialogs, managing databases, and generating conversational content.

Here's an overview of what each file does:

1. `GraphExporterCommand.java`: This class contains methods for exporting graphs from FFT dialogs into GraphML files. It provides a command-line interface for this task.
2. `ConversationGenerationCommand.java`: this class contains methods for generating conversational content based on the extracted data from the graphs. It provides a command-line interface for this task.
3. `LlmManagerCommand.java`: this class contains methods for managing language models, such as setting up and querying LMs. It provides a command-line interface for this task.
4. `DatabaseManagerCommand.java`: this class contains methods for managing databases, such as connecting to and interacting with databases. It provides a command-line interface for this task.
5. `ConversationalWriter.java`: This class is responsible for generating conversational content based on the extracted data from the graphs. It uses various natural language processing (NLP) techniques to create meaningful conversational dialogues.
6. `GeneratorCli.java`: this is the main entry point for the CLI tool. It sets up a command-line interface using Spring Boot and registers all the commands provided by other classes in the package.

The package is designed to be used as a library for generating conversational content based on FFT dialogs expressed as graphml files. The CLI tool can be executed from the command line, allowing users to interactively perform various tasks such as exporting graphs, managing databases, and generating conversational content.

Here's an example of how to use the CLI tool:

1. Export a graph from an FFT dialog into a GraphML file using the `GraphExporterCommand`:
```
java -jar cli-generation-tool.jar graph-exporter /path/to/dialog.fft /path/to/output.graphml
```

2. Generate conversational content based on the extracted data from a graph using the `ConversationGenerationCommand`:
```
java -jar cli-generation-tool.jar conversation-generator /path/to/graph.graphml /path/to/output.conversations
```

3. Manage a database using the `DatabaseManagerCommand`:
```
java -jar cli-generation-tool.jar database-manager connect /path/to/database.db
java -jar cli-generation-tool.jar database-manager query "SELECT * FROM table"
```

4. Use the `LlmManagerCommand` to set up and query language models:
```
java -jar cli-generation-tool.jar llm-manager setup /path/to/openai-api-key
java -jar cli-generation-tool.jar llm-manager query "What is the capital of France?"
```

In summary, the `cli-generation-tool/src/main/java/de/semvox/research/predev/cca/cli` folder contains source code for a command line interface that allows users to interactively perform various tasks related to graph generation and dialog creation. The CLI tool can be used as a library for generating conversational content based on FFT dialogs expressed as graphml files.

## GraphExporterCommand.java

The provided Java code file is a command-line interface generation tool for exporting graphs in various formats. The class `GraphExporterCommand` implements the functionality of this tool. Here's the documentation broken down by section, including explanations of responsibilities, purpose, and important domain concepts:

1. **Package Declaration**
```java
package de.semvox.research.predev.ccA.cli;
```
Declares that the code is part of the package named "de.semvox.research.predev.ccA.cli".

2. **Imports**
This includes multiple imports to support the functionality of the `GraphExporterCommand`. These include exception handling, model classes for graphs, and the logging library for debugging purposes.

3. **Logger Initialization**
Uses Log4j 2 for logging. The static variable `log` is an instance of the logger associated with the class `GraphExporterCommand`.

4. **Class Definition**
```java
public final class GraphExporterCommand implements Runnable { ... }
```
Defines a class named `GraphExporterCommand` that implements the interface `Runnable`, indicating that it can be executed as a command-line application.

5. **Fields and Annotations**
Two fields are defined within this class:
- ```java
  @CommandLine.Option(names = {"-i", "--input"}, description = "The input .graphml file", required = true) private Path input;
  ```
  Declares a command-line option named "input" with short names "-i" and "--input". It is marked as required, meaning the user must provide an input file for the export operation. The `Path` type is used to represent the file path.

- ```java
  @CommandLine.Option(names = {"-f", "--output-format"}, description = "The output format: png, dot, console", required = true, defaultValue = "CONSOLE") private ExportFormat outputFormat;
  ```
  Declares a command-line option named "output-format" with short names "-f" and "--output-format". It is also marked as required. The available formats are defined in the `ExportFormat` enum, which includes PNG, DOT, and CONSOLE.

- ```java
  @CommandLine.Option(names = {"-o", "--output-path"}, description = "The output path for the file. Not required for console output.") private Path outputPath;
  ```
  Declares a command-line option named "output-path" with short names "-o" and "--output-path". It's not mandatory for console output, but required if output format is anything other than CONSOLE.

6. **Run() Method**
This method serves as the main execution point of the command line application when it is invoked.
```java
@Override
public void run() {
    GenerationModule module = new GenerationModule(input, "Filename");
    GraphExportService service = module.graphExportService();

    switch (outputFormat) {
        case DOT:
            if (outputPath == null) {
                log.info("{}", service.exportToDot());
            } else {
                service.exportToFile(outputPath, service.exportToDot());
            }
            break;
        // case PNG and SVG are handled similarly
        default:
            throw new ClientException("Invalid output format specified");
    }

    // Any IOExceptions during export operations are logged as errors and re-thrown as a `ClientException`.
}
```

7. **exportToDot() Method**
This helper method writes the DOT representation of the graph to either the console (if `outputPath` is null) or to a file at the specified path.
```java
private void exportToDot() {
    if (outputPath == null) {
        log.info("{}", service.exportToDot());
    } else {
        service.exportToFile(outputPath, service.exportToDot());
    }
}
```

In summary, the class `GraphExporterCommand` provides a flexible way to export graph data into different formats via command line arguments, allowing users to specify an input path, select an output format (or choose console output), and optionally specify an output file path.

## ConversationGenerationCommand.java

The provided Java code file is for a command-line interface (CLI) generation tool used to generate conversational dialogs from FFT (Financial Forecasting Tool) files. The main class `ConversationGenerationCommand` implements the `Runnable` interface, allowing it to be executed as a standalone application.

This code file contains three subcommands: `SingleFftCommand`, `ScanFolderForFftCommand`, and `ResourcesFftCommand`. These represent different ways to input FFT files, either directly, by scanning a folder for them, or using predefined resources. 

The `generateConversationalDsl(Path fftPath, Path outputPath)` method is used to convert an FFT file into conversational dialogs and save the result in the specified `outputPath`. The `scanFolderAndGenerate(Path basePath, Path outputPath)` method iterates over all subdirectories within the `basePath`, calls `generateConversationalDsl(entry, outputPath)` for each subdirectory found, and handles any potential `IOException`.

The nested class `SingleFftCommand` provides a CLI interface to generate a conversation from an FFT file. It defines two command-line options: `--fft-name` and `--output-path`, which specify the path to the input FFT file and the output file path respectively. When executed, it calls the `generateConversationalDsl(fftPath, outputPath)` method to perform the conversion. If an error occurs during the process, it is caught and a custom exception `ClientException` is thrown.

The main class also overrides the `run()` method provided by the `Runnable` interface, which is used when defining command-line programs with the JCommander library. When the tool is executed with appropriate arguments, this method will run and perform the generation of conversation files based on the specified parameters.

In addition to these main functionalities, the code also includes a nested class `ResourcesFftCommand`, which also implements the `Runnable` interface. This class has one additional command-line option (`outputPath`) that allows specifying an alternative output path for the generated conversation files. The method `run()` in `ResourcesFftCommand` does exactly the same as `ConversationGenerationCommand`, but it uses a default resource path obtained from `FftResourceLoader.defaultResource().getPath()` to scan and generate conversation files. It handles any potential exceptions that may occur during file loading or generation, and logs an error message if such an exception occurs.

Overall, this Java code defines a command-line tool for generating conversation files from a given base path with support for specifying an alternative output path using a command-line option.

## LlmManagerCommand.java

```java
import org.jline.console.ConsoleReader;

public class LlmManagerCommand {
    private static final String MODEL_ID = "gpt-3.5-turbo"; // Example LLM model ID

    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        try (ConsoleReader reader = new ConsoleReader("LlmManager", System.in, System.out, null)) {
            reader.setPrompt("\n>> ");
            System.out.println("Llm Manager v1.0");
            System.out.println("Press Enter to generate language model metadata.");

            String input = reader.readLine();
            if (input != null && !input.isEmpty()) {
                Path fftPath = Paths.get("config.fft"); // Example FFT configuration file path
                Path outputPath = Paths.get("output/metadata.csv"); // Example output path

                LlmConfig config = getLlmConfig(reader);
                LlmModule module = new LlmModuleBuilder(fftPath, config).documentContainer().build();
                MetadataGenerator generator = module.getMetadataGenerator();
                String fileName = sanitizeFileName("inputFile"); // Example sanitized filename

                generator.generate(fileName);
                module.getNlgDatabase().persist(outputPath);
            } else {
                System.out.println("No input provided, exiting.");
            }
        }
    }

    private static LlmConfig getLlmConfig(ConsoleReader reader) throws Exception {
        String apiKey = reader.readLine("\nEnter Open AI API Key (or press Enter to use default): ");
        String endpoint = reader.readLine("Enter Open AI Endpoint (or press Enter to use default): ");
        String deployName = reader.readLine("Enter Deployment Name (optional): ");

        if (apiKey == null || apiKey.isEmpty()) {
            // Use predefined deploy name if no custom API key is provided
            return new LlmConfig(MODEL_ID, endpoint, deployName);
        } else {
            // Use provided API key and custom settings if available
            return new LlmConfig(apiKey, endpoint, deployName);
        }
    }

    private static String sanitizeFileName(String fileName) {
        // Add any necessary filename sanitization logic here
        return fileName; // Example return value
    }
}
```

## DatabaseManagerCommand.java

The provided Java code file contains a command-line interface (CLI) for managing databases in the context of a conversational dialog application called "CCA." The main class `DatabaseManagerCommand` is annotated with `@CommandLine.Command`, indicating that it's a CLI subcommand under the name "db". This class implements the `Runnable` interface, meaning it can be executed as part of a larger program.

The class has two attributes:
1. **spec** (of type `CommandLine.Model.CommandSpec`): this attribute holds the specification of the command-line interface for this subcommand.
2. **log** (of type `Logger` from Log4j 2): an instance of the logger used for logging messages throughout the class.

The class contains three methods:
1. **tryToDelete(Path path)**: a static method that attempts to delete a file located at the given path. If the file does not exist, it logs an informational message and returns without any action. Otherwise, it tries to delete the file; if successful, it logs a success message; otherwise, it throws a `ClientException`.
2. **run()**: The main method of this class, which is annotated with `@Override`, indicating that it should replace the default behavior of the `Runnable` interface when executed. Inside the run method, it prints the usage information for its command-line interface.

The class contains three subcommands:
1. **DatabaseClearCommand** (an inner class)
2. **DatabasePopulate** (another inner class)
3. **PopulateFromResourcesCommand** (yet another inner class)

Each of these subcommands has two options: `dbPath` and `basePath`, with the latter representing the parent folder containing all files and folders to be populated in the database, while the former specifies the output path for the database file. The `run()` method of each subcommand either calls the `populateFromPath(basePath, outputPath)` method or logs an error message if an exception occurs during this process.

In summary, the application provides CLI tools for managing databases by clearing existing files or populating a new database from certain paths. The main class `DatabaseManagerCommand` acts as a central point for handling these operations, while the nested classes represent specific commands and their associated logic.
